# Guilds and Organisations
### Membership benefits
Members of a guild can petition their organization for assistance on their quests. A wizard can consult with his colleagues for information on the haunted swamps he intends to visit, a knight can make sure he gets the sharpest sword from the castle armory, and so on. Petitioners may make an assistance roll (AR), a roll on 3d with a chance of success depending on Rank; see the Assistance Roll Table. In addition, if a guild is sponsoring a quest, members of the adventuring party who aren’t members of the guild may still request assistance as though they were Rank 0.

If several PCs in the same guild request the same help, roll once for the person of highest Rank, adding 1/5 of the total Rank of the others (rounded down) to his Rank. For instance, a Rank 3 underboss in the thieves’ guild, two Rank 2 capos, and a Rank 1 footpad would roll as if their Rank were 3 + (2 + 2 + 1)/5 = 4.

Requests for assistance must be made when an adventurer is in contact with his guild. Since many adventures involve tramping through the wilderness and into remote, dangerous places, this usually means seeking assistance before or after an adventure, much like shopping for equipment. Magicians, mentalists, and others with long distance communication capabilities may be able to “phone home” for information and advice, but the difficulty involved in travel usually means that physical assistance isn’t an option for those already in the field.
#### Modifiers
Odds of assistance are low for low-ranking guild members, but an AR is a success roll, subject to Luck. Several bonuses may apply. Of course, there may be penalties, and if modified AR falls below 3, there’s no chance.

• Person requesting aid has Charisma: +Charisma. ‡
• Person requesting aid makes a suitable skill roll for the organization (see individual guild descriptions for specific skills): +2 for critical success, +1 for success, -1 for failure, or -2 for critical failure.
• Previous requests by team this adventure: -1 per AR after first.
• Request especially appropriate to situation: +1 to +5. †
• Request especially inappropriate to situation: -1 to -10, and failure by 10+ or critical failure means disciplinary action. †
• Specific modifiers: See individual guild descriptions for modifiers that apply instead of or as well as those for appropriateness.

 ‡ Charisma only applies to requests in person, not those made by letter or magical scrying stone.
 † The GM judges what’s appropriate or inappropriate. A wounded Rank 0 recruit might get +5 when shouting for a cleric to heal him, while even a Rank 8 grand high priest would have -10 to request the unsealing of the ancient demon seals “just because.”

| **Rank** | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Military Company
**Rank**: Military Rank 0-8.
**In Charge**: Knights.
**In the Ranks**: Barbarians, brutes, guards, holy warriors, knights, martial artists, scouts, skirmishers, squires, and swashbucklers.
**On Payroll**: Bards, clerics, druids, innkeepers, and wizards.
**Influencing the AR**: Leadership.
Both freelance mercenary organizations and standing state armies are commonplace in worlds where adventure is a viable career choice. They provide fighters of all kin with potential employment and a structure to give them contacts and other social support. But their narrow focus can lead them to engage outsiders for specialized work.
#### Who Military Companies Are
Military companies are purveyors of armed, physical force, warriors from top to bottom. Military companies attract a lot of knights and scouts, as well as their Henchmen-styled counterparts (archers, squires, skirmishers, and guards) and even a few barbarians, holy warriors, martial artists (particularly the armed varieties), and swashbucklers. They may have a small corps of clerics for healing, wizards for battle magic and miscellaneous supernatural support, and innkeepers to handle provisioning. However, such specialists are typically already working at full capacity to support regular units and can’t be spared for special missions. Most other adventuring types must be hired on a mission-by-mission basis as required.
Depending on the history of the company, they may share a common ethnic or racial origin. A number of historical societies were noted for providing specific types of troops (for example, slingers from the Balearic Islands for the Romans, or horse archers from Central Asia for many Asian nations during the Middle Ages). Dwarves may be noted for their sappers and heavy infantry, while elves may be famous for their scouts and massed archery. However, many military companies have few conditions beyond being able to fight and take orders.
Military companies are strongly hierarchical, with a definite chain of command. Smart commanders listen to their underlings before issuing orders, but then what they say goes. Nevertheless, they have a stake in making sure their subordinates are suitably equipped. Maximum Rank for a single company is 5 or 6, but imperial armies can have Rank as high as 8. Use Leadership to influence ARs.
#### What Military Companies Want
Military companies are in the business of killing things, and they’re very good at doing it with physical force and pointy objects. Members of military companies can look forward to countless missions of violence, and looting bodies and conquered territories is a time-honored perk of being a soldier. Of course, they do so as part of a broader strategy, so they may not understand why they need to occupy a given hill or attack a given position, and the fog of war may leave them ill-equipped to deal with conditions on the ground or deprive them of expected support.
But there are often gaps in coverage for tasks which involve subtlety, negotiation, and the supernatural, and military companies may require auxiliaries to perform support missions or neutral parties to handle sensitive tasks. One common capacity in which military companies engage outsiders is for mixed strike forces. Any number of missions require a strong presence of spellcasters to handle supernatural threats and defenses, and thieves or similar sneaky folk to circumvent obstacles which cannot be overcome by force of arms alone. These may include decapitation strikes against enemy commanders and attempts to gather intelligence about enemy forces and movements.
A military company stretched thin with front-line fighting duties may need assistance in performing key logistical tasks. Adventurers may be called on to escort payrolls through dangerous territory or important prisoners from the battlefield to secure rear areas. Hired associates may be involved in missions closer to the front lines for which warriors are poorly suited. Thieves, ninja, and assassins may be prized for their ability to sneak behind enemy lines to gather intelligence, while bards can travel relatively openly, convincingly lying about their true purpose while entertaining opposing forces.
#### What Military Companies Provide
Military companies can give training for traits on the fighter template. Professional items they can supply discounts on include most weapons (excluding disguised weapons and weapons which have only reach C), any armor, and shields.
Military companies can usually respond to these types of ARs:
• Backup. When a military company sends people around to help, they’re trained fighters built on a mix of full knight/holy warrior/scout templates and their closest Henchmen equivalents.
• Map.
• Mounts and vehicles.
• New gear.
• Provisions.
• Training.
Other ARs are at -3 or worse.
