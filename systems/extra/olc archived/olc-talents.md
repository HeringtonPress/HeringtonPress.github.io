## Classes

### Fighter
#### Cut Through (1)
When you kill a creature in Forward with an Offensive Scissor< Action you may gamble a Brawn Die to move that same Hand as a basic attack to another target in Forward.
#### Break Through (1)
When you win with a Forward Rock Action you may gamble a Brawn Die to move that target into Rearward. That enemy must exchange a Hand to move back next round or wait till the round after.
#### Backstab (2)
When you make a Forward Offensive Action against an enemy that doesn't defend against you, deal an additional 2 damage.

### Rogue
#### Picks and Pins (1)
When picking a lock you may Gamble a Brain die to discover what one of the wrong actions is.

### Wizard
#### Spell Slot (2)
Through rigorous study or innate talent, you have found a way to store a spell in your mind like a living page. You may treat your mind as an always in hand spellbook with only 1 slot.
The spell you store there effects your thoughts and emotions but does not control your actions. While you have a Spell in your mind one of your Bonds is randomized.
#### Magic Missile (1)

## Kin
---
Kin Talents can only be taken by PCs of the appropriate Kin.
### Foulkn

### Half-foot
#### All Five (0)
You have exceptional senses, as competent with 4 as most with 5. On any Saves pertaining to perception you always add a d4 to the Roll unless you are missing 1 of your senses in which case you make a normal roll. In combat if an Action attempts to inflict a Condition based on your senses you are immune unless it targets 2 or more of your senses. 
#### Magic Sickness (0)
Due to your short life span you kin never adapted to reserving mana within. You lose Gambled Magic Dice on the 3 highest results (excluding d4s).

### Elf
#### Magic Resilience (0)
Due to your long lived nature and ancestral history of mana exposure you are more resilient to spells and curses. The duration of negative magic effects are halved for you.
#### Slow to Bond (0)

### Dwarrow
#### Strong (0)
Strong and powerful, especially for their size, even the weakest Dwarrow can out pace most of the other Kin. Whenever you don't have any Brawn dice in reserve you may add a d4 to a Brawn Save.
#### Steady (0)
Dwarrow are natural sprinters, lacking the stamina of other Kin. When you would gain stress you gain an additional stress if you have no Brawn Dice in reserve.
