## [Classes](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc-classes/)
Classes define what you are good at. What distinguishes you as an adventurer. Select one Class, get it's starting gear and all of it's #A abilities.
## Background
Who you were before your career as an adventurer. When making a save you may bargain with the Guide to add the Background value to a Save. You start with 4 Background points that can be distributed as you like. A single Background can never be raised above 4.
## Tongues
You know Common and one additional Language. You can also spend a Background point to learn an additional Tongue.
- **COMMON**: Understood by all sentient creatures.
- **WROTE**: Indecipherable even by magic, unspoken.
- **SIGHTLENT**: Silent without eye contact, only truthful.
- **JOTUNG**: Travels far, sounds like nature.
- **FAELUL**: Understood by plants & animals.
- **GOBTOK**: Lingers on the air for days, putrid smell.
- **LIGHTLENT**: The tongue only travels through shadow.

## Inventory Slots

| Can contain:   | 1 Stress   | 1 medium weapon  |
| Bundle of rope |  quiver   | 1/2 heavy weapon |
| 3 rations      | 1 treasure | 3 light items  |

You begin play with 10 Slots and 2 additional QUICK-DRAW Slots. Items kept in QUICK-DRAW Slots may be retrieved freely in combat.
Small Items kept in a slot alone can be drawn as if in a QUICK-DRAW Slot.
## Hit Points, Grit, & Scars
**Grit**: Don't get hit points. It represents your ability to mitigate harm.

**Hit Points** represents physical damage. You take HP damage after you've used up all your Grit--or take damage in such a way that you can't avoid, e.g., falling into lava goes straight to HP.

You have 6 HP and die when they have less HP then -your max HP.

If you're HP is in the negatives but you're not dead, a character can use a First Aid Kit to heal you to 0 HP. Being healed in this way gives you 1 Stress.
## Experience
Gain 1XP for every Gold Piece(GP) spent. XP can then be spent to:
- Swap a Class Template. **200XP**
- Gain a Background Point. **200XP**
- Increase your Max HP by 1 to a maximum of 10. **400XP**
- Gain a new slot of inventory to a max of 13. **600XP**
- Gain an additional Class Template. **800XP**

# Resolving Actions
---
## Saves
When doing anything with an interesting or dangerous chance of failure you roll 2d6, trying to roll higher then 8. A task's difficulty will grant you a bonus or penalty to your roll.
## Gambling and Dice Pools
To gamble dice decide the size of the pool and then roll all of them, losing any dice that show the highest 2 results of that die.

An important note when it comes to you pools is that whenever you would gain dice into a pool it replaces the current dice in said pool.
## Bidding Lore
Information and lore are categorised into 3 levels of obscurity.

- **Common Lore**: Everyone knows this. The GM will tell you all about this. 
- **Rare Lore**: Few know this. You must have an applicable background and must roll a Brain Die as if you gambled it. Regardless of the result you know the information.
- **Lost Lore**: None know this. You roll a Save and must Gamble at least 1 Brain Die. On a success you know where to learn more information about this.

# Cooking Feasts
---
A **feast** is a moment of actual rest in the middle of hostile and hungry darkness. Depending on the make up of the feast, characters might gain Grit, Magic, Brain, or Brawn Dice.

To create a feast, you require:
- **Two unique ingredients**
- **One portion per character**

In addition, you must fulfill 3 of the following 4 criteria:
- Fire
- Water
- Cooking gear
- Spices

A feast must be prepared and then immediately consumed. No leftovers.

Each creature eaten provides a number of portions. Two rat yields about one portion. A minotaur yields about eight. A dragon could feast upwards of fifty adventurers.   

The GM adds together any nutritional benefits from the unique ingredients used to make a feast and tell the players the totals for each nutrient (see below). Decimals are rounded as God intended and Nutrients can't be higher the 5. Players then select 2 nutrients to benefit from this meal, gaining an amount of dice equal to it's respective value.
## Nutrients
Each feast has four stats, called **Nutrients.** 
- **Energy** determines how many calories a feast has. This nutrient gives a character Grit.
- **Minerals** provide needed magical energy. This nutrient refills a character's Magic Dice. 
- **Vitamins** are good for your brain. This nutrient reinforces a character with Brain Dice. 
- **Protein** builds strong bones and muscles. This nutrient reinforces a character with Brawn Dice.

### Food Dice
Food Dice (FD) are either d4s, d6s or d8s. 
- If the feast contained **mundane** animals or plants, the Food Dice are equal to d4s. 
- If the feast contained majority **exotic** ingredients, the Food Dice are equal to d6s. 
- If the feast contained extraordinarily **magical** ingredients, like a dragon or an angel, the Food Dice are equal to d8s. 

### Energy
**If the players benefit from energy:** After the feast, characters roll as many FD as the feast's energy rank. The character's current Grit score is immediately replaced with the new total, if it is higher. 
### Minerals
**If the players benefit from minerals:** They gain magic dice (MD) of the same die type and number as the feast's mineral rank. A character can hold a maximum amount of magic dice equal to their number of Templates. These MD are held until spent and expended through casting spells.
### Vitamins
**If the players benefit from vitamins:** They gain Brain Dice of the same die type and number as the feast's Vitamin rank. This pool replaces the current pool. These Dice can be Gambled when making a predominantly mental Save.
### Proteins
**If the players benefit from proteins:** They gain Brawn Dice of the same die type and number as the feast's Protein rank. This pool replaces the current pool. These Dice can be Gambled when making a predominantly physical Save.
## Rations & Meals in Town
Eating a ration grants 1d4 in any one nutrient. Before an adventure or when resting in civilization you can spend 10gp to gain 4d4 spread how you like. 
# Bonds
---
The relationships you have with all the other members of your party are called Bonds. Bonds are noted on your Character Sheet: "I am Calryn's Lover - Brain".

Your Bonds become charged when you Fulfill them, exemplifying the relationship the Bond represents. Basic suggestions for this role-play are given in the descriptions of the example Bonds below. Though the GM can call for a Bond to be Charged by other examples of excellent role-playing, including but not limited to risking ones well being for their Bond. 

A charged bond can be spent to gain a d6 in the attribute you assigned it at creation; Grit, Magic, Brawn, or Brain. Alternatively you can spend a charged bond to heal 2 HP during a Feast. 

## Ally
Your allies are party members that you are professional and amiable with. This is the default Bond.
- Charge this bond when you make your Ally laugh both in and out of character.

## Adversary
If you have a significant problem with a party member you're probably their adversary. This isn't an excuse to be an ass to another player, but an opportunity for interesting and fair conflict.
- Charge this Bond when you witness your adversary fail a Save.

## Best Friend
You wouldn't let your best friend go on an adventure without you. You're there for each other, thick or thin.
- You both charge this Bond when you reveal a secret to your best friend.

## Love
Use this Bond to represent someone you are in romantic relationship with. If the relationship is one-sided, use the Unrequited Love Bond.
- Charge this Bond when you do something gushy and romantic for your partner, whether it's writing an in-character love sonnet or risking your neck to pick a bunch of flowers for them.

## Master/Henchman
When you have a managerial vs. subservient relationship with another party member, this is your Bond.
- Masters charge this Bond when they give their henchman an agreed-upon payment or compensation.
- Henchmen charge this Bond when they use 

## Mentor/Mentee
Whether a parent, parent-figure, or merely a leader, a mentor guides and shapes the life of a mentee.
- Mentees charge this Bond when they ask the mentor for advice.
- Mentors charge this Bond when a mentee follows their advice.

## Rival
You are in competition with your rival. You might want the same woman, the most kills, or something weirder.
- Charge this Bond when you witness your rival succeed on a Save.

## Unrequited Love
He's just not that into you. use this Bond to represent how you feel about a would-be suitor or ex-lover.
- The Desperate charges this Bond when they do something kind or romantic for your Love.
- The Love charges this Bond when they turn down or rebuff acts of love from the Desperate.

## Guard/Ward
You have a party member that you look out for. It's important they survive.
- Guards charge this Bond when their Ward makes it out of lethal danger without taking damage.
- Wards charge this Bond when they get into lethal danger.

# [Spells and Magic](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc-spells/)
---
# Exploring
---
## Watches
Days spent Exploring are split into 4 Watches. Your Guide rolls an Omen each Watch and an Omen rolled twice in a journey becomes an Encounter.
## Actions
- **MOVE** to a hex and see all non-hidden features in it. Receiving stress based on the difficulty of the terrain you are entering.

Easy = 0 | Neutral = 1 | Difficult = 2 | Treacherous = 3

- **SEARCH** a hex. 2-6 chance for each hidden feature of the Hex. 4-6 with directions.

- **SCOUT** the area. Spend a watch patrolling the borders of a Hex seeing the terrain of neighboring hexes.

- **CONFRONT** an Omen or roll a new encounter.

- **MAKE CAMP**. New Omens rolled in camp are ignored.

- **DELVE** Unless obviously more time is taken, Delving into and exiting a dungeon takes a Watch.

- **REST** Take a moment to recuperate, lose all Stress, but the GM will roll for Omens twice. While resting you may Feast.

## Vehicles
Riding a mount or vehicle reduces all Stress received from travel by 1.

Vehicles moving through Difficult or worse terrain have a 1-6 chance of breaking, which requires a Watch to fix.
# Delving
---
## The Underclock
Starting at 20 when entering a dungeon, an Encounter is triggered when the Underclock reaches below 0.

You roll a d6 Dungeon Die and subtract it from the Underclock whenever the party expends time or generates noise. Actions that prompt an Underclock Roll include:
- Exploring a new room (including long hallways).
- Moving through 3 already-explored rooms.
- Lingering or searching.
- Making noise (excluding Combat).

Most Dungeon Die rolls are considered a Turn, representing approximately 10 minutes of time.

Additional details about the Underclock:
- If the Underclock drops below 0, an Encounter is triggered.  After the Encounter resolves, the Underclock resets to 20.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 0 exactly, it resets to 3.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 3, a Omen occurs.

## Resting
While eating a ration is just a turn. Resting and cooking a feast takes some time.
You’ll have to roll some Underclock Rolls.
- If you are resting in the middle of a well-traveled location, make 3 rolls.
- If you are in a secret room that no one else knows about, you don’t need to make any rolls.
- Everything in between is either 1 or 2 rolls.

## Light
Light sources state how many people they provide for. Without enough light for everyone, roll the Underclock die twice and keep the higher result. With no light at all the die size is also increased.

Whenever the Underclock die rolls, roll the usage die of any light sources lit.
## Locks
Requires lockpicks and selecting the correct actions in order. These actions are TWIST, TAP, and TURN. Always 3 never 2 in a row. Upon selecting the wrong action, the lock will become stiff. If the lock was already stiff, the lock is jammed and becomes unable to unlock.

Each failed attempt rolls the Underclock die.

Locks of the same type are all opened the same way.

Some Modifiers that can diversify the locks are below:
- CRACKED: On the first action, any action taken is correct.
- WEATHERED: Ignore the first time a lock would jam.
- SECURED: The first wrong action causes the lock to jam.
- SPIKED: Wrong actions deals d4 damage to the picker.

## Stealth
Moving silently and unseen is a Save with a bonus equal to your empty slots and a penalty equal to the amount of armour filled slots.

When sneaking as a group everyone saves but only half of the group is required to succeed.
## Degeneration and Leaving the Dungeon
Every time you leave the Dungeon, the biggest treasure pile in the dungeon loses around 20% of its value, stolen away by agents of the Underworld.

The exception to this is if you have a camp setup outside the dungeon you may make a pitstop. Roll the Dungeon die once when exciting and again when re-entering though these rolls may never lower the clock beyond 3.
# Fighting
---
## Initiative
Each round the GM describes what it appears the enemy is going to do. Save Cunning vs the largest enemy HD to act first.
On your turn you may take two actions. Move Zones, attack, trip, fetch an item, or raise a shield. Get creative.
## Attacking & Defending
When attacking simply roll the weapons damage, dealing it to the enemy. If you attack multiple times you only deal the biggest damage. When being attacked you may Gamble your Armour Dice to avoid damage.
## Zones
There are 4 zones in a typical combat encounter. These are Forward↑ and Rearward↓ for allies and enemies. Ranged attacks can be volleyed from any Zone but melee is limited to Forward.
![Zone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeringtonPress/HeringtonPress.github.io/master/assets/img/Zone.png)
Combatants in Forward must target an enemy in Forward, while combatants in Rearward may target whoever they choose.
If a sides Forward is empty then everyone on that sides Rearward is considered to be Forward.

## Fleeing
If the party agrees to retreat then bar dire circumstances they escape. Each character that escaped gains 2d3 Stress. Any items dropped in the pursuit are lost to the dungeon. Fleeing in this way leaves any fallen or captured ally behind, unless you are holding the fallen and have the slots to do so. The average human is 6 Slots and dragging allows you to ignore their encumbrance.

| Medium | d8    | 1     | 10    |
