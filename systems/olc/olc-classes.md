# The Classics
If the abundance of choices is intimidating or you simply don't need anything crazy. These classes are familiar, reliable, and easy to pick up and play.
## [Knight](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/knight/)
You are a Knight of the Emperor. You shield is not your own, your armor is your companions, and your blade cuts only the wicked. Where a mercenary fights, you guard. When a soldier follows, you command.
## [Slayer](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/slayer/)
You are a killer. Powerful and efficient. Where most people run in terror from monsters that could raze cities, you ready your weapon.
## [Thief](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/thief/)
Not to be confused with a common pickpocket. You are an adventurer, a delver in purest form. Any self respecting party would beg on hands and knees to the guilds in order to have a Thief in their line up. For a party without a Thief is a party unprepared.
## Orthodox Wizard
(See below)
# Wizards 
Wizards, a category of classes, are masters of spells. Having spent their lives learning how best to trap, harness, and bargain with the living spells with their tomes they all share a few key abilities.
#### Spell Slots
You have practiced storing spells in you mind as apposed to in living wood. You can keep a number of spells stored in your brain equal to your number of Wizard Templates. Spells prepared in this way do not require a book or wand to cast.
#### Cantrips
Each Wizard class has a collection of minor abilities that they may evoke freely at anytime. These small magical abilities are stains left by the magic that has been stored in their brains manifesting as parlor tricks.
#### Spell Breeding  
You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:  
- a random spell  
- a mutant version of one of the two spells  
  
When the process is complete, Save -6 or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus for  
- every 10 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade  
- the number of Wizard templates you possess  
- each ritual preparation you describe to the GM 

## [Orthodox Wizard](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/orthodox-wizard/)
Identified by your Blue Robes you are a master of magics. Unburdened by schools, classification, or creed, you study magic in near all it's forms. As a Blue Wizard you are seen as equal parts reliable and unpredictable by your piers.
# The Remaining
## [Alchemist](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/alchemist/)
You are mad. Genius but foolish and perhaps even more obsessive then any Wizard. You have decided that the laws of the world untouched by magic is yours to grind, bottle, and command. You are mad.
## [Deserter](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/deserter/)
You are a coward. You fled when others fought, when others died. The weight of your guilt rests solely on your back, wearing away at your good boots.
## [Rat King](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/rat-king/)
Some like to imagine themselves as gods when they stand over an anthill. Watching them march in lines and circles to avoid their every step. They are fools. Godhood is not found in ants avoiding your wake. It's found in the rats. In their devotion. In their worship. In their sacrifice.
