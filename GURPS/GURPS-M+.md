# Age and Aging
You can start at any age that falls within your Kin’s usual lifespan. However, unless you are Unaging, you will experience gradual decline once you age past a certain point.

Beginning at age 50, make a series of “aging rolls” each year to see if old age is taking its toll. At age 70, roll every six months. At age 90, roll every three months!

- Starting at or above one of these age thresholds is a disadvantage costing -2 for each threshold.

Aging rolls are a series of four HT rolls – one for each of your four Basic Attributes, in the following order: ST, DX, IQ, then HT. You may not use any form of Luck on these rolls.
> Modifiers: +2 if you are Very Fit, +1 if Fit, -1 if Unfit, or -2 if Very Unfit.

On a failure, reduce the attribute in question by one level. A critical failure, or any roll of 17 or 18, causes the loss of two levels.

When you lose an attribute level to age, reduce your point value accordingly. Reduce all secondary characteristics reflect the new level. If any Basic Attribute reaches 0 from aging, you die a “natural” death.

With the GM's permission, you may lose advantages or gain disadvantages of equivalent point value instead of losing an attribute point. For example, your Appearance could decline, or you could gain Hard of Hearing.
# Starting From Scratch
If you lose a character and have to make a new one you go through character creation just as you had before. Starting with the same amount of points everyone else started with.

If, however, your previous character receives a funeral you will receive a portion of Character Points to use on your new character.

- For no funeral you receive 0 character points.

- For a quick and cheap/free funeral you receive 1/5 of the difference between starting points and previous points.

- For a planned but inexpensive funeral you receive 1/4 of the difference.

- For a typical, expensive funeral you receive 1/3.

- For an honorable, luxurious funeral you receive 1/2.

If the body is unavailable a token of them may be used in its place. Doing so reduces the Points received to the previous tier. Without a token or body reduce it by 2 tiers. If the funeral rites don't match the character's faith or culture reduce it by another tier.

# Slots and Armour
3 DR per slot(?)

# Advanced Combat
## Extra effort
Various actions can be modified by pushing yourself, physically and mentally, beyond your regular limits. Extra Effort must be declared before resolving any part of an action. E.g. you must declare extra effort melee before rolling to hit.

**Melee attacks**: When you take the Attack maneuver with a melee weapon, you may spend 1 FP to gain the damage from All-Out Attack Strong without giving up defense.

**Ranged attacks**: When you take the Attack maneuver with a ranged weapon, you may spend 1 FP to attack with a +1 to hit.

**Rapid strike**: halve penalty for rapid strike, 1 FP per attack.

**Defense**: When you make an Active Defense, you may spend 1 FP to get a +2.

**Sprinting**: When you have full movement, you may spend 1 FP to move an additional half of your Basic Move.

**Step**: When you Step you may spend 1 FP to move an additional hex.
## Banter
Action heroes never shut up in combat – an actor has to earn his pay, after all. But it sometimes serves a purpose. Below, Psychology works like an Influence skill, because in the movies, skilled police psychologists and negotiators are good at this stuff!

**Drawing Aggression**: You can use Fast-Talk or Psychology to unleash taunts and jibes calculated to draw an opponent’s aggression. Take a Concentrate maneuver and roll a Quick Contest of skill against the higher of the enemy’s IQ or Will. If you win, that foe comes after you, changing targets if necessary. A tie does nothing. If you lose, he targets a hurt or otherwise vulnerable team member just to spite you! Win, lose, or tie, if you roll a critical success, your mark also makes an All-Out Attack on his next turn.

**Uttering Threats**: You can try Intimidation or Psychology to discourage an enemy, provided that he’s neither Indomitable nor Unfazeable. This works at -5 once combat has begun – but a gun gives you a bonus equal to the absolute value of its Bulk (e.g., +4 for a .50AE hand-cannon), and you get +1 if you light up your rival with a targeting laser. Then roll as for drawing aggression. Victory by 5 or more means he flees the fight. If you win by 1-4, your opponent hesitates, taking that many All-Out Defense maneuvers, but doesn’t leave. If you tie or lose, he comes after you! This trick only works while the team allows enemies to run away unscathed. Shooting one in the back dooms this option to failure for the rest of the encounter.
## Close quarters
When making an attack at a target closer then your reach, you have a penalty to hit equal to your maximum reach × 4. When parrying the penalty is max reach × 2. For weapons that require you to shift your reach use the current max reach for these calculations.
## Under water
- Default swimming speed is move/5 rounded down. Step grants no movement unless your swim speed is above 4.
- Weapon skills are capped by the Swimming skill, unless you have the Swim spell on or are Aquatic or Amphibious.
- Sw damage suffers a penalty of -2 x max reach. Thr damage suffers -1 x max reach.
- Ranged attacks into and out of the water are at -4, 1/10 range, -1 per die of damage, some attacks can't penetrate.
- No Parry except unarmed or close combat weapons, no Block (but you get DB), Dodge is normal for your move.
## Grappling
If you have an empty hand, you can grab foes or their equipment. You must be in your opponent’s hex to try this.

Each attempt requires an Attack, All-Out Attack, or Move and Attack maneuver, and is considered an attack. If your opponent is lying down or kneeling, you must kneel or lie down unless your rival’s Size Modifier is two or more greater than yours; however, you may do this as the step of an Attack maneuver.

Roll against DX or a grappling skill – Brawling – to hit.

*Modifiers*: Instead of standard modifiers for hit locations and weapons, apply 0 to hit the torso; ‑1 for an arm or leg; ‑3 for the head; or ‑4 for something someone is holding (like a weapon). add your SM difference as a bonus, in favour of larger grapplers. If using more then 2 hands, +2 per hand beyond the first 2. Your opponent defends normally. The effects of a hit depend on what you grabbed.

- If you grabbed an item, you’re now grasping it; if it’s a weapon, your rival cannot use it to attack or defend. On subsequent turns, you may try to wrestle it away. Each attempt counts as an attack and requires a Regular Contest of ST. If you win, you take the item away. If you lose, you lose your grip and must start over.

- If you grabbed your foe, your victim is now at ‑4 to DX – which gives ‑2 to blocks and parries, and ‑1 to dodges – while you’re holding on. Until your opponent breaks free or you let go, your victim cannot move away. (Exception: You cannot prevent a rival with more than twice your ST from leaving . . . you’re just extra encumbrance!) You may try *Actions After a Grapple* on subsequent turns.

If you grappled a body part other than the torso, all of the above applies and that one body part cannot be used to attack or defend. There are also additional effects:

- **Arm**: You cannot snatch a weapon away, but you can force your victim to drop it. Roll a Regular Contest of ST exactly as if you had grabbed the weapon.

- **Leg**: You get +3 if you try a takedown (below).

- **Head**: You may attempt to strangle (below).

Grappling someone doesn’t mean that person is grappling you! If your foe wants to do that, he must grapple on his turn. Grappling someone doesn’t give you defense penalties, either. However, you can’t parry with a limb without releasing its hold on your victim.

#### Actions After a Grapple
Grappling a foe lets you try special moves on later turns, provided your victim hasn’t broken free. Each requires an Attack or All-Out Attack maneuver, and counts as an attack.

**Takedown**: Bear a standing opponent to the ground. Roll a Quick Contest, with each contestant using the highest of ST, DX, or best grappling skill. If you aren’t standing, you have the usual attack penalty for posture. If you’re grappling your enemy’s leg you get +3. If you win, your victim falls down in your hex, losing his grip if he was grappling you. If you lose, you suffer those effects! On a tie, nothing happens.

**Pin**: Prevent an opponent who’s lying down from acting. You must be grappling your foe’s torso. Roll a Regular Contest of ST. The larger fighter gets +3 per point of Size Modifier difference. The fighter with the most free hands has +3. If you win, your foe is now helpless; you must stay there to hold him down, but you can free one hand for other actions. If you lose or tie, nothing happens.

A hand not committed to grappling can be used for an Attack, All-Out Attack, or Ready maneuver. You can bite even if your hands are busy. To Aim, Feint, Concentrate, Wait, or make a ranged attack you must first pin your foe.

You may also perform these free actions on your turn:
- Release your grip with one or more hands.
- Drag or carry your victim. Only after pinning your foe, unless you have more than twice your opponent’s ST. Just move or step normally, dragging or carrying your enemy (who counts as encumbrance, likely reducing your Move).

#### Actions After Being Grappled
If you’re grappled, you can’t take a Move maneuver unless your ST is more than twice your foe’s. Aim, Concentrate, Wait, and ranged attacks are impossible. If you’re pinned, you can’t take any maneuver that requires physical movement except to Break Free.

**Break Free**: Attempt to end your enemy’s grapple or pin. This counts as an Attack maneuver. You may try every turn if grappled, every 10 turns if pinned. Roll a Quick Contest of ST. Your opponent gets +5 if grappling you with two hands or pinning you with one, +10 if pinning you with two. If either of you has three or more arms, each arm beyond the first two gives +2. If you win, you’re free and may step immediately. If your rival falls unconscious or dies, you’re automatically free at once; a stunned foe doesn’t let go but has ‑4 in the Contest.

If you prefer, you have other options:

**Attack or All-Out Attack**: You can try if not pinned! You cannot use any limb or weapon that has been grappled. The ‑4 for being grappled, and any posture penalty, still apply.

**Ready**: You can Ready an item if you have a hand free and aren’t pinned, but you must roll vs. DX. Failure means you drop the item. A Ready to switch an ability off or on always works.

## Fire
### Making Things Burn
Materials are grouped into six “flammability classes,” based on the amount of burning or incendiary damage needed to set them aflame:
- Super-Flammable (e.g., black powder, ether): Negligible damage (candle flame).
- Highly Flammable (e.g., alcohol, paper, tinder): 1 point.
- Flammable (e.g., dry wood, kindling, oil): 3 points.
- Resistant (e.g., seasoned wood, clothing, rope, leather): 10 points.
- Highly Resistant (e.g., green wood, flesh): 30 points.
- Nonflammable (e.g., brick, metal, rock, fireproof synthetics): N/A.
### Catching Fire
A single hit that inflicts at least 3 points of basic burning damage ignites part of the victim’s clothing. This does 1 burning damage per second and is distracting (-2 to DX, unless the damage simply cannot harm the target). To put out the fire requires a DX roll as a Ready maneuver.

A single hit that inflicts 10 or more points of basic burning damage ignites all of the victim’s clothes. This does 1d-1 burning damage per second and is very distracting (-3 to DX, except when rolling to put out the fire). To put out the fire, the victim must roll on the ground. This requires a DX roll, and each attempt takes three Ready maneuvers.

If a wooden shield takes 10 or more points of burning damage it ignites, the bearer is at -2 to DX, and takes 1 burning damage per second until they gets rid of it.

In all cases, remember to apply shock penalties to DX if the flame inflicts injury!

The above guidelines assume ordinary clothing. Armor is good protection against fire; clothing worn over armor (e.g., a surcoat) might burn, but the armor’s DR reduces the damage normally. Clothing that is wet or worn under armor is almost impossible to ignite, and won’t stay lit. On the other hand, fancy dresses, lace cuffs, and so on, ignite if they take even 1 point of burning damage!

Remember to divide damage from tight-beam burning attacks by 10 when applying the rules above.
## Falling
Some special considerations:

Circus Act: A falling victim can try an Acrobatics roll; success subtracts five yards from the fall. Someone with Catfall gets this benefit automatically, and may roll vs. DX to halve damage. Ignore this for falls onto spikes.

What’s Down There? Falling damage is normally crushing. Halve basic crushing damage if the victim lands on something soft, such as corpses. Ignore falling damage for landings in fluids.

The Bigger They Are . . . Falling damage assumes someone of SM 0. For bigger creatures multiply the basic damage by an additional 0.5 for each SM. 

Wear a Crash Helmet! Damage Resistance protects against falling damage, Use the average DR. As the sudden stop can cause whiplash, minimum injury is 1 HP of per full 5 points of basic damage rolled.

My Poor, Aching Feet: Roll 3d on the Hit Location Table (pp. 99-100). If the result is an arm, leg, hand, or foot, and injury sustained could cripple that body part, it’s crippled. The victim still suffers full injury – not just the minimum needed to cripple!

### Falling Damage Table
| Distance | Damage |  Distance  | Damage |
|:--------:|:------:|:----------:|:------:|
|  1 Yard  |   1d   |  30 Yards  |   5d   |
| 2 Yards  |  1d+1  |  35 Yards  |  5d+2  |
| 3 Yards  |  1d+2  |  40 Yards  |  6d-1  |
| 4 Yards  |  2d-1  |  45 Yards  |   6d   |
| 5 Yards  |   2d   |  50 Yards  |  6d+2  |
| 10 Yards |   3d   |  60 Yards  |   7d   |
| 15 Yards |  3d+2  |  70 Yards  |  7d+2  |
| 20 Yards |   4d   |  80 Yards  |  8d+1  |
| 25 Yards |  4d+2  | 100+ Yards |  9d+1  |

## Conditions
### Irritating Conditions
Any combination of penalties to attribute, active defense, self-control, and skill rolls is possible!

Coughing or Sneezing: You’re at -3 to DX and -1 to IQ, and cannot use Stealth.

Crippling: A specific body part temporarily experiences Effects of Crippling (p. 61).

Disadvantage: You temporarily acquire one or more disadvantages (Adventurers, pp. 56-68).

Euphoria: You’re at -3 to DX, IQ, skill, and self-control rolls.

Intoxicated: You’re affected as if you had partied too hard! Tipsy gives -1 to DX and IQ, and -2 to self-control rolls except those to resist Cowardice. Drunk doubles these penalties.

Itching: You’re at -2 to DX for the itch’s duration. Scratching relieves the itch, but this requires a Do Nothing maneuver in combat.

Knockdown: You fall prone and drop anything you’re holding, as if you had failed the HT roll under Knockdown (p. 60).

Nausea: You have -2 to all attribute and skill rolls, and -1 to active defenses. As well, roll vs. HT if you’re exposed to a foul odor or stunned, or fail a Fright Check – and roll every hour if riding a mount, wagon, ship, etc. Failure means (25 - HT) seconds of vomiting; treat as retching (p. 66).

Pain: You have a penalty to all DX, IQ, skill, and self-control rolls: -2 for moderate pain, -4 for severe pain, or -6 for terrible pain. High Pain Threshold halves penalties; Low Pain Threshold doubles them.

Slow: You get a turn only every two, three, or more seconds in combat, depending on the affliction. Your last maneuver is considered to be in effect if you’re attacked between turns.

Slower Move: Your Move in all mediums (but not Basic Speed) is reduced by some percentage up to 80%, rounded down, to a minimum of Move 1.
### Incapacitating Conditions
These afflictions prevent you from taking some or all voluntary action while they last. Many also leave you stunned: you must Do Nothing each turn, defend at -4, and cannot retreat.

Agony: You’re in such pain that you can only moan or scream. If standing or sitting, you fall down. While the affliction endures, you’re stunned and lose 1 FP per minute or fraction thereof. Low Pain Threshold doubles the FP loss. High Pain Threshold lets you overcome the agony enough to act, but at -3 to DX and IQ.

Choking: You cannot breathe or speak. While this endures, you suffer the effects of Suffocation (p. 70). You’re also stunned – although you may sit, kneel, or go prone if standing, or go prone if kneeling or sitting. Targets that don’t breathe are unaffected.

Daze: You’re conscious – and if standing, you remain upright – but you can do nothing, not even defend. If slapped, shaken, or injured, you’ll recover on your next turn unless the specific effect says otherwise.

Ecstasy: You’re incapacitated with overwhelming pleasure. Treat as agony (above), but neither Low Pain Threshold nor High Pain Threshold has any effect.

Hallucinating: You can try to act but must roll vs. Will before each success roll. Success means you merely suffer 2d seconds of disorientation; this gives -2 on success rolls. Failure causes you to hallucinate for 1d minutes; the penalty is -5. The GM is free to specify the details of hallucinations, which needn’t be visual. On a critical failure, you “freak out” for 3d minutes – you might do anything! The GM rolls 3d; the higher the roll, the more dangerous your action.

Paralysis: You cannot move any voluntary muscles, and will fall over if not in a balanced position. You cannot defend, or attempt any action that requires speech or movement, but you don’t have to Do Nothing – you remain conscious and can use abilities or spells that require neither speech nor movement.

Retching: You’re conscious but vomiting (or suffering dry heaves). You cannot benefit from potions – you’ll just throw them up! You can act, but you have -5 to DX, IQ, and Per, and automatically fail at anything that requires a Concentrate maneuver. When the affliction ends, you lose 1 FP.

Seizure: You suffer a fit. Your limbs tremble uncontrollably, you fall down if standing, and you cannot speak or think clearly. You can do nothing, not even defend. When the affliction ends, you lose 1d FP.

Sleep: You fall down if standing and sleep for the duration. If slapped, shaken, or injured, you’ll recover on your next turn unless the specific effect says otherwise.

Stasis: You and your gear stop in time. You’re frozen in place – in mid-action or even midair! You can do nothing; you’re unaware of the universe and can’t act at all, not even mentally. The universe can’t affect you, either; you can’t be injured, moved, deprived of equipment, or affected by supernatural powers. Any effect that was already in progress (fire, poison, etc.) halts for the duration. Unlike paralysis (above), stasis affects even beings without muscles or metabolisms.

Stunned: You suffer Mental Stun (p. 27) or Stun (p. 60). Depending on the cause, you may get IQ or HT rolls to recover or remain stunned for a fixed duration.

Unconsciousness: You’re knocked out, just as if you had suffered injury. Nothing short of an Awaken spell can revive you.
### Mortal Conditions
Coma: You suffer no actual injury but collapse as if you had been wounded to -1xHP or below and passed out, with effects as described in Recovering from Unconsciousness (p. 62): a single HT roll to awaken after 12 hours and eventual death if you fail.

Heart Attack: Your heart stops and you collapse! You drop to 0 HP and -1¥FP, if you were above those levels. Regardless of current HP, you’ll die in HT/3 minutes (round up) unless rescuers restore all your HP and FP, and then make an Esoteric Medicine roll (each attempt takes a minute). If you die, treat this as death at -1¥HP or your current HP, whichever is worse. Beings without hearts – including Homogeneous and Diffuse monsters – are unaffected.

Petrifaction: You and your gear turn to stone. You cannot act and aren’t conscious. Magic can cure this condition – but while it endures, you’re considered inanimate, not living or even formerly living.
