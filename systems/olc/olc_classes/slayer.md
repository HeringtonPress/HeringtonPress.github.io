**Starting Equipment**: 

- **A:** Parry, Critical Hit
- **B:** Notches
- **C:** Powerful Blows
- **D:** Monster Hunter

**Parry**: You may Gamble your Weapon Dice as Armor Dice. Doing so either before or after Gambling Armour.

**Critical Hit**: When you roll max damage with a weapon die, add +2 to the total damage dealt.

**Notches**: Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, and 40, kills with a weapon *type* (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below.
- +1 Damage
- Expanded critical range (+1)
- Special ability (negotiated with GM). Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

**Powerful Blows**: When you make a weapon attack you can gamble brawn dice, adding the sum to the damage dealt.

**Monster Hunter**: Keep track of the highest HD of monster you have killed. You can add this number to the damage of an attack. Doing so deals equivalent damage to your grit.
