# Travel
An adventurer's goals often take them outside of their starting town. If the course of a journey lacks importance or even sufficient risk, the GM is encouraged to skip as much as they can. Though it is also important, in making the world feel dangerous and lived in, to have encounters on the road. Below are rules for how to handle these journeys when called for.
## Getting There Quickly
The pace of the party is the Move of the slowest member times 10 Miles per day.

Delvers must carry, forage, or conjure three meals apiece per day of travel. If they eat less, they’ll be missing 1 FP per skipped meal (and 1 HP per FP below 0!) on arrival. A few hours of rest won’t restore these FP. This FP penalty will persist until the group rests with food for one day per 3 FP lost – easy in town, risky at the dungeon doors.

Typically, the GM will roll daily for random encounters, be those bandits, dire wombats, or friendly merchants. More days mean more chances to get killed!

Thus, it’s important to minimize travel time. There are three tricks for this. For each, any success knocks 10% off travel time, failure adds 10%, and critical failure adds 20%. The results are additive, giving from -30% to +60% travel time. The party can opt out of any of these rolls.

**The Golden Path**: If the party appoints a guide, that person can make a Navigation roll (at -5 with just the shadows of the trees, -1 with a sundial, or no modifier with a compass) to pick an optimal route over the best terrain.

**Wind at Your Back**: If the guide has Weather Sense, a successful roll lets the party walk or sail with the wind, avoid storms . . . whatever. This is fantasy weather!

**Forced March**: If the party is traveling overland, everyone can try Hiking, Riding, or Skiing, as appropriate, to move quickly; use the worst result. On water, one hero can roll against Boating for a small craft, Seamanship for a large one, to make good time.
## Foraging
Rations are expensive, and cumbersome to lug around (you have to bring enough to make the return trip!). Next to magic, foraging is the best way around that. Only a traveler who knows Fishing, Naturalist, or Survival – no defaults – can forage in a world with killer bunnies and man-eating shrubs. Roll once per trip.

Success means the adventurer needs only half as much food from rations; e.g., 60 meals instead of 120 on a 40-day journey. Critical success means the delver can either consume no rations or halve the rations used by himself and one companion.

Failure still means some good days – but mostly bad ones. The traveler needs only 2/3 as many rations. Critical failure means relying on rations like everyone else. This is probably a disaster: an outdoorsman counting on foraging and carrying less food will be half-dead after a long trip – or the whole party will be weak, if they’re nice and share their food.
## Camping and Posting Watches
Camping requires no special skill, but the party should post watches. The order isn’t important; when a nighttime encounter occurs, the GM will randomly determine whose watch it interrupts, and secretly roll against the higher of Perception or Observation for that PC. This becomes a Quick Contest against the Stealth skill of sneaky enemies.

If the watch-keeper succeeds (wins, in a Contest), the party isn’t surprised – although those who were asleep start combat lying down. Otherwise, everyone is asleep or stunned; each delver must make one IQ roll per turn, at +1 per turn after the first and +6 for Combat Reflexes, and can react only on the turn after succeeding.

**Wilderness Camps**: If a nighttime encounter involves enemies that hunt by sight, the GM will roll a Quick Contest: the monsters’ Vision vs. the party’s highest Camouflage skill, at a penalty equal to the number of party members who have no points in that skill. Victory means the enemy spends enough time searching that any watch-keeper gets a second chance to detect them, as above. If the watcher succeeds on both perception checks then the party has enough time to start the fight standing but not readied.

**Dungeon Camps**: When sleeping in a dungeon, camouflage won’t work – but if the room has doors, use the same rules with the party’s highest Traps (and no penalty) to set simple noise-makers. In that case, victory means the monsters awaken the party; the delvers won’t be surprised. Sleeping heroes still start combat lying down, though.
