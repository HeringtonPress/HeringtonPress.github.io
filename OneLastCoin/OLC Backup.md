## Alignment
Every Character bar the rare exceptions begin play with a Neutral Alignment. Your alignment determines what you can do with your Miracles. Alignment with Law and Chaos comes at a cost. Members of the apposing Alignment see you no longer as a bystander but as a foot soldier of the enemy.
## Miracles
You have a max amount of Miracles equal to your level. Regaining an amount equal to your recovery die after expending them all and resting. Miracles can be spent to do the following.

| Lawful                          | Neutral                            | Chaotic                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Re-roll a save (Someon else's)  | Deal maximum damage with an attack | <--                    |
| Lower damage dealt to you by d6 | <--                                | Re roll a save (Yours) |
| Lower CR by 4                   | Lower CR by 2                      | Lower CR by d6         |

## Background
Who were you before your career as an adventurer. When making a save you may bargain with the Guide to subtract the value of one of your backgrounds from the CR.

You start with 4 Background points that can be distributed as you like. A single Background can never be raised above 4.
## Tongues
You know Common and one additional Language.
- **COMMON**: Understood by all sentient creatures.
- **WROTE**: Indecipherable even by magic, unspoken.
- **SIGHTLENT**: Silent without eye contact, only truthful.
- **JOTUNG**: Travels far, sounds like nature.
- **FAELUL**: Understood by plants & animals.
- **GOBTOK**: Lingers on the air for days, putrid smell.
# Progression
## Experience
You gains a point of EXP for every Gold Piece you spend.
## Training
You may spend a sum of Gold over 50 to train with an expert. You gain an additional 25% EXP of whatever you spend on Training.

| Level |  EXP  | HP (Max 20) | Templates | Recovery | Slots |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----------:|:---------:|:--------:|:-----:|
|   1   |   -   |      -      |     1     |   1d3    |   8   |
|   2   | 2000  |     +2      |     2     |   1d3    |   8   |
|   3   | 4000  |     +2      |     3     |  1d3+1   |  10   |
|   4   | 6000  |     +2      |     4     |  1d3+1   |  10   |
|  5+   | +4000 |     +4      |           |  1d3+2   |  12   |

## Strengthen
When you level up, Test your Stats for improvement. Roll 3d6 for each Stat. If the result of the roll is equal to or higher than your max, increase the Stat by 1. If the result of the roll is 5 or more below, reduce the Stat by 1.

Stats can never be higher then 18 or lower then 6.

Your class will determine your Prime Stat which you instead roll 4d6 and keep the highest 3 on when Testing.


# Exploring
## Watches
Days spent Traveling are split into 6 Watches. Your Guide rolls an Omen each Watch and an Omen rolled twice in a journey becomes an Encounter.
## Actions
**MOVE** a hex and see all non-hidden features in it. Receiving stress based on the difficulty of the terrain.

Easy = 0 | Neutral = 1 | Difficult = 2 | Treacherous = 3

**SEARCH** a hex. 2-6 chance for each hidden feature of the Hex. 4-6 with direction.

**CONFRONT** an Omen or roll a new encounter.

**MAKE CAMP**. Watches taken in camps don’t roll Omens.

**SLEEP** for 2 watches. Counts as a Long rest. Going a day without sleep gets you one fewer watch next day.
## Mounts & Vehicles
Mounts and Vehicles reduces stress from moving by 1.

Vehicles moving through Difficult or worse terrain have a 1-6 chance of breaking, which requires a Watch to fix.

# Delving
## Turns
Crawls are tracked in 10 minute Turns. There is a 1-6 chance of an Omen each Turn. An Omen left ignored will quickly become an Encounter.

In an especially dangerous location the chance of an omen may increase with each lucky roll.
## Movement
You can move from one room to another and explore the new room in 1 turn. Moving through 2 explored rooms in a turn assumes moving with caution. You could move through 6 rooms in a turn. Doing so, Omens become Encounters and Traps go unnoticed.
## Other Activities
- Identifying magic takes a Turn.
- Deciphering something/reading a book takes 3 Turns.
- Combat and looting takes a Turn.
## Light
Light sources state how many people they provide for.

Without enough light for everyone, Omens become Encounters and Traps go unnoticed.
## Doors
Opening a stuck door is CR 4 by base, though this may increase if the door is heavy, large, and/or obstructed. Using a prybar reduces the CR by 4.

Trying to force a stuck door open takes one turn.

You may also choose to break it down. This takes some time and causes much more noise.
## Locks
Requires Thieves’ tools and selecting the correct actions in order. These actions are TWIST, TAP, and TURN. Always 3 never 2 in a row. Upon selecting the wrong action, the lock will become stiff. If the lock was already stiff, the lock is jammed and becomes unable to unlock.

Each failed attempt takes 1 turn.

Locks of the same type are all opened the same way.

Some Modifiers that can diversify the locks are below:
- CRACKED: On the first action, any action taken is correct.
- WEATHERED: Ignore the first time a lock would jam.
- SECURED: The first wrong action causes the lock to jam.
- SPIKED: Wrong actions deals d4 damage to the picker.
## Stealth
Moving silently and unseen is a Dexterity Save with a CR equal to your total filled slots, excluding Quick Slots.

When attempting to sneak as a group, one member of the group Saves. The CR is equal to the total filled Slots of the group, divided by half of the group, rounded up.
# Fighting
## Rounds
Each Round the Guide describes what it appears like the monsters are going to do. Save Cunning plus the highest HD amongst the enemies to act first.
## On Your Turn
You take two actions per round.

Move to an adjacent zone, Strike, trip, get infront of an ally, fetch an item, or raise a shield. You may only Strike once.

Get creative.
## Attacking
Save the relevant Stat, dealing damage on a success.

Brawn for melee, Cunning for ranged.

Being attacked? Save Defense or take damage.

If you are dual wielding roll both damage dice and take the higher result.

## Sunder Shields
Raised shields reduce damage by their roll but splinter on a max roll.
## Zones
When combat starts the Table will divide the location into at least 3 Zones. Each zone signifying a sort of Landmark in the area.
## Death & Dying
When taking damage beyond 0 HP, gain a Scar.
## Scars
Scars are horrifying and beautiful reminders of the dangerous life you live. When you gain a Scar make note of what it looks like and how you got it. Mark it as open and make a Deathroll.

Closing Scars depends on the capabilities of the Guild.
## Deathrolls
Save 3d3 under open Scars dying on a failure. Overexerting subtracts from your Max HP which does not recover. Forgo the Deathroll to instead suffer a Major Scar or fall unconscious.
## Major Scars
Debilitating trauma that often serve a new challenge to overcome for the rest of your life. They cannot be closed. Often things such as missing limbs or lost senses, it is up to you and the Guide to figure out how it manifests.
## Rest & Healing
**SAFE REST**: A weeks rest in a safe location. Heal all HP, remove all stress, and roll Recovery. Dividing the Recovery result among the Stats that have been overexerted.

**SHORT REST**: Consume a ration and rest an hour. Doing so recovers 2 HP, once a day.

**LONG REST**: When camping out, roll Recovery to remove stress and heal 2 HP for every Boon you have. Reduce the amount of healing received by 2 for every Bane.

**BOONS**
- Bedroll   • Booze/Drugs
- Shelter   • Fire
- Freshly cooked meal

**BANES**
- Wet/Cold • Sick
- Hungry    • Combat
- Evil environment

## Cooking
Done as part of a Long rest or any reasonable Watch. Requiring at least 2 unique ingredients and creating a serving for each ingredient used.

Monster parts and other Arcane ingredients typically grant magical effects.

1-6 chance of success with +1 for each of the following.

• Fire • Water • Cookware • Seasoning
