Olc everything is usage dice. Choose how many armour dice to roll to defend. Lose em on a max roll. Armory kit to fix during a camp rest. Shields can be gambled before armor where as armor must be rolled in one.

Weapons deal number of dice dependent on slots. Small items take a slot but can be quick drawn when not stacked. Ie one dagger can be quick drawn from any slot but 3 dagger fit in a slot.

You wager knowledge (his majesty the worm )

Make camp turns bigger deals. Feasts should be camp turns.

Initiative is roll against free slots?

Fatigue needs a new purpose and such do rations.
