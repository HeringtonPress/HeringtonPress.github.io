## Wizards  
#### Spell Slots
You have practiced storing spells in you mind as apposed to in living wood. You can keep a number of spells stored in your brain equal to your number of Wizard Templates. Spells prepared in this way do not require a book or wand to cast.

#### Spell Breeding  
You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:  
a) a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)  
b) a random spell from a random spell list  
c) a mutant version of one of the two spells  
  
When the process is complete, Save Cunning -6 or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus for  
a) every 10 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade  
b) the number of Wizard templates you possess  
c) each ritual preparation you describe to the GM 

### Orthodox Wizard
**Starting Equipment**: dagger, spellbook with 2 spells, ink and quill, and Blue Robes.
- You learn an additional Spell every Template.
- **A:**Â Cantrips
- **B**: Signature Spell.
- **C**:
- **D**:

**Cantrips**:
1. Change the colour or texture of an object smaller than a horse for 10 minutes.
2. Create a tiny light as bright as a match on a fingertip.
3. Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll or turn a page.

**Signature Spell**: You designate one spell you use frequently as your main spell. This Spell has grown entwined with you and you with it. It lives in your brain and doesn't take a spell slot. It can be stored temporarily in living wood but will always find it's way back to you. You can always cast this spell as if you gambled 1d4 regardless of available Magic Dice.
