# Techniques
You (or your GM!) may want a way to improve your ability with a specific application of a skill without increasing the overall skill level. Allowing this in the game makes play (and character sheets) more complex. As a result, the following section is purely optional.

You need not buy a technique to use it. If you have even one point in a skill, you may use all that skill’s techniques at default. To avoid a cluttered character sheet, though, only note techniques that you know at better than default level.
