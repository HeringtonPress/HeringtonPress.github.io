## Grappling
If you have an empty hand, you can grab foes or their equipment. You must be in your opponent’s hex to try this.

Each attempt requires an Attack, All-Out Attack, or Move and Attack maneuver, and is considered an attack. If your opponent is lying down or kneeling, you must kneel or lie down unless your rival’s Size Modifier is two or more greater than yours; however, you may do this as the step of an Attack maneuver.

Roll against DX or a grappling skill – Brawling – to hit.

*Modifiers*: Instead of standard modifiers for hit locations and weapons, apply 0 to hit the torso; ‑1 for an arm or leg; ‑3 for the head; or ‑4 for something someone is holding (like a weapon). add your SM difference as a bonus, in favour of larger grapplers. If using more then 2 hands, +2 per hand beyond the first 2. Your opponent defends normally. The effects of a hit depend on what you grabbed.

- If you grabbed an item, you’re now grasping it; if it’s a weapon, your rival cannot use it to attack or defend. On subsequent turns, you may try to wrestle it away. Each attempt counts as an attack and requires a Regular Contest of ST. If you win, you take the item away. If you lose, you lose your grip and must start over.

- If you grabbed your foe, your victim is now at ‑4 to DX – which gives ‑2 to blocks and parries, and ‑1 to dodges – while you’re holding on. Until your opponent breaks free or you let go, your victim cannot move away. (Exception: You cannot prevent a rival with more than twice your ST from leaving . . . you’re just extra encumbrance!) You may try *Actions After a Grapple* on subsequent turns.

If you grappled a body part other than the torso, all of the above applies and that one body part cannot be used to attack or defend. There are also additional effects:

- **Arm**: You cannot snatch a weapon away, but you can force your victim to drop it. Roll a Regular Contest of ST exactly as if you had grabbed the weapon.

- **Leg**: You get +3 if you try a takedown (below).

- **Head**: You may attempt to strangle (below).

Grappling someone doesn’t mean that person is grappling you! If your foe wants to do that, he must grapple on his turn. Grappling someone doesn’t give you defense penalties, either. However, you can’t parry with a limb without releasing its hold on your victim.

#### Actions After a Grapple
Grappling a foe lets you try special moves on later turns, provided your victim hasn’t broken free. Each requires an Attack or All-Out Attack maneuver, and counts as an attack.

**Takedown**: Bear a standing opponent to the ground. Roll a Quick Contest, with each contestant using the highest of ST, DX, or best grappling skill. If you aren’t standing, you have the usual attack penalty for posture. If you’re grappling your enemy’s leg you get +3. If you win, your victim falls down in your hex, losing his grip if he was grappling you. If you lose, you suffer those effects! On a tie, nothing happens.

**Pin**: Prevent an opponent who’s lying down from acting. You must be grappling your foe’s torso. Roll a Regular Contest of ST. The larger fighter gets +3 per point of Size Modifier difference. The fighter with the most free hands has +3. If you win, your foe is now helpless; you must stay there to hold him down, but you can free one hand for other actions. If you lose or tie, nothing happens.

A hand not committed to grappling can be used for an Attack, All-Out Attack, or Ready maneuver. You can bite even if your hands are busy. To Aim, Feint, Concentrate, Wait, or make a ranged attack you must first pin your foe.

You may also perform these free actions on your turn:
- Release your grip with one or more hands.
- Drag or carry your victim. Only after pinning your foe, unless you have more than twice your opponent’s ST. Just move or step normally, dragging or carrying your enemy (who counts as encumbrance, likely reducing your Move).

#### Actions After Being Grappled
If you’re grappled, you can’t take a Move maneuver unless your ST is more than twice your foe’s. Aim, Concentrate, Wait, and ranged attacks are impossible. If you’re pinned, you can’t take any maneuver that requires physical movement except to Break Free.

**Break Free**: Attempt to end your enemy’s grapple or pin. This counts as an Attack maneuver. You may try every turn if grappled, every 10 turns if pinned. Roll a Quick Contest of ST. Your opponent gets +5 if grappling you with two hands or pinning you with one, +10 if pinning you with two. If either of you has three or more arms, each arm beyond the first two gives +2. If you win, you’re free and may step immediately. If your rival falls unconscious or dies, you’re automatically free at once; a stunned foe doesn’t let go but has ‑4 in the Contest.

If you prefer, you have other options:

**Attack or All-Out Attack**: You can try if not pinned! You cannot use any limb or weapon that has been grappled. The ‑4 for being grappled, and any posture penalty, still apply.

**Ready**: You can Ready an item if you have a hand free and aren’t pinned, but you must roll vs. DX. Failure means you drop the item. A Ready to switch an ability off or on always works.
