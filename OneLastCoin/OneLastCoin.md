## Saves

## Alignment
Every Character bar the rare exceptions begin play with a Neutral Alignment. Your alignment determines what you can do with your Miracles. Alignment with Law and Chaos comes at a cost. Members of the apposing Alignment see you no longer as a bystander but as a foot soldier of the enemy.

You have a max amount of Miracles equal to your level. Regaining an amount equal to your recovery die after expending them all and resting. Miracles can be spent to do the following.

## Background
Who were you before your career as an adventurer.

Backgrounds are just a word that describes something a PC knows and can do without saves. Typically a failed profession or area of knowledge.
## Tongues
You know Common and one additional Language.
- **COMMON**: Understood by all sentient creatures.
- **WROTE**: Indecipherable even by magic, unspoken.
- **SIGHTLENT**: Silent without eye contact, only truthful.
- **JOTUNG**: Travels far, sounds like nature.
- **FAELUL**: Understood by plants & animals.
- **GOBTOK**: Lingers on the air for days, putrid smell.
# Progression
## Experience
You gains a point of EXP for every Gold Piece you spend.
## Training
You may spend a sum of Gold over 50 to train with an expert. You gain an additional 25% EXP of whatever you spend on Training.

| Level | EXP  | HP  | Recovery | Slots |
| ----- | ---- | --- | -------- | ----- |
| 1     | -    | -   | 1d3      | 8     |
| 2     | 400  |     | 1d3      | 8     |
| 3     | 800  |     | 1d3+1    | 10    |
| 4     | 1200 |     | 1d3+1    | 10    |
| 5+    | +500 |     | 1d3+2    | 12    |
## Strengthen
When you level up, Test your Stats for improvement. Roll 3d6 for each Stat. If the result of the roll is equal to or higher than your max, increase the Stat by 1. If the result of the roll is 5 or more below, reduce the Stat by 1.

Stats can never be higher then 18 or lower then 6.

Your class will determine your Prime Stat which you instead roll 4d6 and keep the highest 3 on when Testing.


# Fighting
## Rounds
Each Round the Guide describes what it appears like the monsters are going to do. Save Cunning plus the highest HD amongst the enemies to act first.
## On Your Turn
You take two actions per round.

Move to an adjacent zone, Strike, trip, get infront of an ally, fetch an item. You may only Strike once.

Get creative.
## Attacking
Save the relevant Stat, dealing damage on a success.

Brawn for melee, Cunning for ranged.

Being attacked? Save Dexterity or take damage.
## Zweihand
When wielding 2 weapons or a weapon with 2 hands, roll a d4, adding the result to the Attack and Damage.
## Armour
Gives you a ‘pool’ of Armour Dice (AD) equal to the Armour Value (AV). Each AD is a d6.

When taking damage, you gamble AD. Roll the AD you gambled, reducing the incoming damage by the result. ADs that roll a 5 or 6 are marked as Chipped.

Chipped ADs are put aside and can’t be used. During a Long Rest, with a smithing kit you can try to fix them. Roll above the AV and the die is no-longer Chipped, else the die is Broken and needs to be repaired by a Smith.

Shields and helmets add +1 each to the AD pool.
## Zones
When combat starts the Table will divide the location into at least 3 Zones. Each zone signifying a sort of Landmark in the area.
## Death & Dying
When taking damage beyond 0 HP, gain a Scar.
## Scars
Scars are horrifying and beautiful reminders of the dangerous life you live. When you gain a Scar make note of what it looks like and how you got it. Mark it as open and make a Deathroll.

Closing Scars depends on the capabilities of the Guild.
## Deathrolls
Save 3d3 under open Scars dying on a failure. Overexerting subtracts from your Max HP which does not recover. Forgo the Deathroll to instead suffer a Major Scar or fall unconscious.
## Major Scars
Debilitating trauma that often serve a new challenge to overcome for the rest of your life. They cannot be closed. Often things such as missing limbs or lost senses, it is up to you and the Guide to figure out how it manifests.
## Rest & Healing
**SAFE REST**: A weeks rest in a safe location. Heal all HP, remove all stress, and roll Recovery. Dividing the Recovery result among the Stats that have been overexerted.

**SHORT REST**: Consume a ration and rest an hour. Doing so recovers 2 HP, once a day.

**LONG REST**: When camping out, roll Recovery to remove stress and heal 2 HP for every Boon you have. Reduce the amount of healing received by 2 for every Bane.

**BOONS**
- Bedroll   • Booze/Drugs
- Shelter   • Fire
- Freshly cooked meal

**BANES**
- Wet/Cold • Sick
- Hungry    • Combat
- Evil environment
