# Overview
GURPS-M only uses six-sided dice, and uses abbreviations for die rolls – for instance, a roll on three dice would be shown as “3d”.
## Task Resolution
The basic mechanic of GURPS is the success roll against a skill or attribute. To succeed, you (or the GM) must roll less than or equal to your skill or attribute level on 3d. The GM may assign modifiers to your skill from -10 (extremely hard) to +10 (extremely easy). A 3 on the dice always succeeds and an 18 always fails!

Sometimes two characters are competing to do something very quickly – for instance, two enemies lunging for a gun. This is called a quick contest. Each competitor attempts a success roll. If one succeeds and the other fails, the winner is obvious. If both succeed, the winner is the one with the largest margin of success. If both fail the winner is the one with the smallest margin of failure. A tie means no one won – it's up to the GM to determine what happened.
## Reaction Rolls
If the PCs encounter a non-player character (NPC) whose relationship to the PCs has not already been determined, the GM may roll 3d6 for a reaction. On a roll 6 or below, the NPC is hostile and works against the PCs. A roll of 7-14 is neutral – he might talk and barter, but won't help. A roll of 15-18 is friendly, and means he actively helps the PCs. A reaction roll may be used as an immediate way to see how an NPC will interact with a character but should also be used after a question is asked or a conversation had.

## Influence Rolls
An “Influence roll” is a deliberate attempt to ensure a positive reaction from an NPC. A PC with an appropriate “Influence skill” can always elect to substitute an Influence roll for a regular reaction roll in suitable circumstances.

Decide which Influence skill you are using: Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, Intimidation, Savoir-Faire, Sex Appeal, or Streetwise. Choose wisely! The GM may allow other skills to work as Influence skills in certain situations (e.g., Expert Skill (Law), when dealing with a judge). Then roll a Quick Contest: your Influence skill vs. the subject’s Will.

Modifiers: All your personal reaction modifiers (although the GM or the skill description may rule that some modifiers do not apply); any specific modifiers given in the skill description; -1 to -10 for using an inappropriate Influence skill (GM’s decision).

If you win, you get a “Good” reaction from the NPC – “Very Good” if you used Sex Appeal. On any other outcome, the NPC resents your clumsy attempt at manipulation. This gives you a “Bad” reaction – “Very Bad” if you attempted intimidation. Exception: If you used Diplomacy, the GM will also make a regular reaction roll and use the better of the two reactions. Thus, Diplomacy is relatively safe.

If the subject is Indomitable (p. 60), you lose automatically unless you have Empathy, Animal Empathy, Plant Empathy, or Spirit Empathy, as appropriate. Intimidation attempts against those with the Unfazeable advantage (p. 95) also fail automatically. On the other hand, you win automatically – no roll required – against those with Slave Mentality (p. 154).

# Character Creation
## Character Points
characters are created by spending **Character Points (CP)**. The GM will assign you a starting budget to build your character.

- Ordinary Folk [25-75]
- Heroes in the Making [75-125]
- Professional Adventurer [125-175]
- Named Heroes [175-250]
- Living Legends [250+]

Characters are defined by their **Attributes**, **Skills**, and **Traits**. All of which cost **CP**. Lowering scores or taking negative traits can even give you more **CP** to spend. However you can never receive more then 60 starting **CP** back from negatives.
## Attributes
Each attribute starts at 10 (Foulkn average) for free. They can be increased using **CP**. A good rule of thumb is that PCs shouldn't have attributes below 8. The four attributes are as follows.

**Strength (ST)**: Sets **Hit Points (HP)**, **Encumbrance**, and **Damage (Dmg)**. Costs 10 **CP** per level.

**Dexterity (DX)**: Helps determine **Speed** and is used for many skills. Costs 20 **CP** per level.

**Intelligence (IQ)**: Determines **Perception**, **Resist Fear**, and is used for many skills. Costs 20 **CP** per level.

**Health (HT)**: Governs how well you resist bad effects, your **Fatigue Points (FP)** and helps determine **Speed**. Costs 10 **CP** per level.
## Secondary Attributes
These are derived from Attributes, as follows.

**Hit Points (HP)**: Your body's ability to sustain injury. Your **HP** starts equal to your **ST** and costs 2 points to increase. Can generally only be raised by 50% of **ST**.

**Fatigue Points (FP)**: Your body's “energy supply”. Your **FP** starts equal to your **HT** and costs 3 points to increase. Can generally only be raised by 50% of **HT**.

**Encumbrance**: It is equal to **ST**²/10. This is the amount of slots you can carry without being slowed. You can carry up to double this but suffer the penalty of half movement and a -2 to **dodge**.

**Will (Will)**: your ability to withstand psychological stress and resist supernatural attacks. Equal to **IQ** and costing 5 points to increase. You cannot raise **Will** past 20, or lower it by more than 4.

**Perception (Per)**: Your general awareness and accuracy with your senses. Equal to your **IQ** and costs 5 points to increase.

**Basic Speed**: A measure of your reflexes. Your Basic Speed is your HT and DX added together and divided by 4. Used to determine initiative. Do not round off – a 5.25 is better than a 5. It can be increased by 0.05 for 1 point.

**Basic Move**: A measure of how far you can move in one turn, in hexes (yards). This is equal to your Basic Speed with no fractions; e.g. a Basic Speed of 5.25 gives a Basic Move of 5. It can be increased for 5 points.

**Damage (Dmg)**: Dmg is further broken up into Swing damage (Sw) and Thrust damage (Thr). Both are based on your ST. Consult the chart below to determine your damage. Note that this is a damage roll, not a fixed result, and can be further modified by the weapon you wield. (Any modifier of +4 is converted to 1d.)

| ST  | Thrust | Swing |    | ST  | Thrust | Swing |
| --- | ------ | ----- | -- | --- | ------ | ----- |
| 9   | 1d-2   | 1d-1  |    | 15  | 1d+1   | 1d+2  |
| 10  | 1d-2   | 1d    |    | 16  | 1d+1   | 2d-1  |
| 11  | 1d-1   | 1d    |    | 17  | 1d+2   | 2d-1  |
| 12  | 1d-1   | 1d+1  |    | 18  | 1d+2   | 2d    |
| 13  | 1d     | 1d+1  |    | 19  | 2d-1   | 2d    |
| 14  | 1d     | 1d+2  |    | 20  | 2d-1   | 2d+1  |

>Example: We want to make a warrior with 100 points. Warriors tend to have high strength but low intelligence. We spend 50 points to raise our ST to 15, since it costs 10 points per level. We lower our IQ to 8, returning 40 points, since it refunds 20 points per level. We keep DX and HT at their default values of 10. We have spent a net total of 10 points and have 90 points left to spend.

## Skills
Skills govern what your character is good at. Skill costs depend on their controlling attribute and their difficulty (Easy, Average, Hard or Very Hard). This is usually written in the form “IQ/E” for, as an example, an Intelligence/Easy skill. 

The chart below shows the cost of skills. To determine the cost, find the skill level you wish to obtain on the chart relative to the skill's controlling attribute, then look across to the difficulty. That is the number of points you must spend to learn that skill at that level.

| Skill Level | Easy | Average | Hard | Very Hard |
| ----------- |:----:|:-------:|:----:|:---------:|
| Attribute-3 |  -   |    -    |  -   |     1     |
| Attribute-2 |  -   |    -    |  1   |     2     |
| Attribute-1 |  -   |    1    |  2   |     4     |
| Attribute+0 |  1   |    2    |  4   |     8     |
| Attribute+1 |  2   |    4    |  8   |    12     |
| Attribute+2 |  4   |    8    |  12  |    16     |
| Extra +1    |  +4  |   +4    |  +4  |    +4     |

>Example: We wish to purchase the Fast-talk skill, which is a IQ/A skill. If our character has a IQ of 13, buying Fast-talk 13 would cost 2 points. Fast-talk 14 would cost 4, etc.

While every character should have at least one weapon skill, you need more than just weapons to survive. For a full list of Skills check [here](Skills.md).

It is also not uncommon to have a starting cap on your skill level. Commonly being unable to begin play having bought a skill above 12.
## Traits
Traits are details about your character and how they interact with the game; world and system. Certain traits are required to establish the fundamentals of your character while even more can be taken to extrapolate. Below is a checklist of important traits you should take - even just to clarify a 0 point default.
### Kin
Your Kin is a representation of your ancestry. The most common Kin, Foulkn, costs nothing and grants nothing. While other Kin have various advantages and disadvantages, nothing is set in stone as anyone may differs from the norm.

Whenever possible try to express your character's idiosyncrasies outside of your Kin Template. Even if you must change aspects of your Kin Template you must never shift the overall price of it.

An exception to this is when you wish to play a character with a "mixed" ancestry. In this case you should pick and choose the aspects of the kin involved in a way fitting of your vision of the character. The ending point cost must be equal to the point value of the lowest cost Kin Template, with Foulkn counting as 10 for this purpose.
### Appearance
Appearance is rated in levels. Most people have “Average” appearance, for 0 points. Good looks give a reaction bonus. Unappealing looks give a reaction penalty. These reaction modifiers only affect those who can see you! Those who cannot see you might have to make a new reaction roll upon first meeting you in person (GM’s option).

Reaction modifiers due to appearance only affect humans or beings that finds humans attractive.

**Ugly**: You have any sort of disgusting looks you can come up with. This gives -2 on reaction rolls. -8 points.

**Unattractive**: You look vaguely unappealing, but it’s nothing anyone can put a finger on. This gives -1 on reaction rolls. -4 points.

**Average**: Your appearance gives you no reaction modifiers either way. 0 points.

**Attractive**: You don’t enter beauty contests, but are definitely good looking. This gives +1 on reaction rolls. 4 points.

**Handsome** (or Beautiful): You could enter beauty contests. This gives +4 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your gender, +2 from everyone else. 12 points.
##### Special Option
**Androgynous**: If your appearance is Handsome (Beautiful) or better, you may specify that your looks appeal equally to all sexualities. You get a flat reaction modifier instead of a gender dependent bonus: +3 for Handsome
### Language
Assuming most characters can read and write their “native” language. This ability costs no points, but you should note your native language on your character sheet; e.g., “Common (Native) [0].” Less comprehension is a disadvantage worth negative points.
#### Comprehension Levels
The point cost to learn an additional language depends on your “comprehension level”: a measure of how well you function in that language overall. Writing and speaking comprehension are separate traits. There are four comprehension levels:

**None**: You don’t know the language at all. 0 points.

**Broken**: You know just enough to get by in daily life, but you’re at -3 when using skills that depend on language. 1 point for spoken, 1 point for written.

**Accented**: You can communicate clearly. You’re only at -1 when using skills that depend on language. 2 points for spoken.

**Fluent**: You can use the language as well as an educated native. 3 points for spoken, 2 points for written.
#### Literacy
Your written comprehension level determines your degree of literacy in that language:

**None**: A written comprehension level of None means that you cannot read the language at all.

**Broken**: A written comprehension level of Broken means you must read slowly. Roll vs. IQ just to get the basic meaning!

**Fluent**: A written comprehension of Fluent means you can read and write at full speed.
### Status
Status is a measure of social standing. In most worlds, Status ranges from -2 (serf or street person) to 8 (powerful emperor), with the average man being Status 0 (freeman or ordinary citizen). If you do not specifically buy Status, you have Status 0. Status costs 5 points per level. 

Status greater than 0 means you are a member of the ruling class in your culture. Your family may be nobles, businessmen or politicians, or some other type of big shots. You may even have achieved Status by your own efforts. As a result others (in your culture only) defer to you, giving you a bonus on all reaction rolls equal to the difference in Status, unless they resent your Status.

High Status carries various privileges such as entrance into fine establishments, access to certain traders, and more. Note that any high-Status person is a likely target for kidnappers and social climbers, and that some folk hate “the ruling class.”
#### Rank
As Status but specific to an organisation such as military or guild. Costing 3 points for each level of rank.
### Wealth
**Very Wealthy**: You start with $20,000 and +2 Status. 30 points.

**Wealthy**: You start with $5,000 and +1 Status. 20 points.

**Comfortable**: You start with $2,000. 10 points.

**Average**: You start with $1,000. 0 points.

**Struggling**: You start with $500. -10 points. 

**Poor**: You start with $200 and -1 Status. -15 points.

**Dead Broke**: You start with nothing and -2 Status. -25 points.
### Advantages
An advantage is a useful trait that gives you a mental, physical, or social “edge” over someone else who otherwise has the same abilities as you. Like all traits, each has a cost in **character points**. For some advantages, this cost is fixed. Others are bought in levels, usually at a flat cost per level.
### Disadvantages
A disadvantage is a problem or imperfection that renders you less capable than your attributes, advantages, and skills would indicate. That includes anything with a negative character point cost.
### Meta-Traits
Meta-Traits are a collection of Traits that function as one trait. Meaning that any Disadvantages within the Meta-Trait does not count against the negative **Character Point** limit, unless the Meta-Trait itself is worth negative points. The most popular example of Meta-Traits are Kin.
### Modifiers
Modifiers are extra details about Traits that shift the overall price. Typically represented by a positive or negative percentage. 
> Example: A creature with flight must pay 40 Points. If this flight is granted by wings the price is modified by -25% due to the risks and requirements of winged flight. Meaning a winged creature only needs to pay 30 points for flight.

# Combat
Combat proceeds in rounds. A round lasts one second. Each round, characters act in the order of their Basic Speed, with the highest number going first. Each player chooses a Maneuver for their character from the following list. Most characters can make only one maneuver each round.
## Maneuvers
### Basic Maneuvers
**Move**: Use this maneuver to take Full Movement.

**Attack**: Attack an enemy with a ready weapon. A successful attack requires a success roll against your effective skill with the weapon. If you succeed the target must then fail to Defend (see active Defense below). The exception is if the enemy does not know you are there they do not get to defend, e.g. an attack from behind. As part of your Attack you may Step.

**Aim**: This maneuver can only be used with ranged attacks. Aim at a specific, visible enemy or point. If you attack your target with the same attack on your next turn, you may add your attack's Acc bonus to your effective skill – but if you lose sight of your enemy, make an Active Defense, change targets or change weapons, the bonus is lost. As part of your Aim you may Step.

**Ready**: Used for any predominantly physical activity not covered by another maneuver. Use this Maneuver to draw a weapon, pick something up, or load a ranged weapon. Some actions require multiple or even concurrent readies, such as retrieving a potion from you backpack. As part of your Ready you may Step.

**Concentrate**: Focus on a primarily mental task - Spellcasting, non combat skills, or activating an ability that requires this maneuver. If the activity takes successive Concentration you become distracted when: taking damage, making an Active Defense roll, being shoved, or making a resistance roll. You must make a Will roll at -3, failure means you lose your concentration. As part of Concentrate you may Step.

**Free Actions**: Free actions can be performed at any time and do not take up the character’s turn. The most common free actions are to drop something and to talk.
### Advance Maneuvers
**All-Out Attack**: Sacrifice the ability to make any Active Defenses till your next turn to make an attack with full might. Specify one of the three options below when choosing this maneuver with a melee weapon.
 **Determined**: Make one attack with a +4 to hit. 
 **Double**: Make two attacks against the same foe, if you have two ready weapons or one that doesn't have to be readied after use.
 **Strong**: Make one attack. If you hit you get +2 to damage or +1 per die.
If you All-Out Attack with a ranged weapon you instead get +1 to hit.
As part of your All-Out Attack you gain Half Movement.

**All-Out Defense**: Spend all you effort on defending yourself. Add +2 to one active defense of your choice: Dodge, Parry, or Block. This bonus persists until your next turn.
As part of your All-Out Defense you gain Half Movement.

**Move and Attack**: Gain full Movement and then attack with a -4 to hit to a maximum effective skill of 9.

**Wait**: Do nothing unless an event you’ve specified in advance occurs before your next turn. Specify the Maneuver and the specific trigger. You gain the movement of the prepared Maneuver which may be taken immediately or once triggered but cannot be split.

#### Attack options
**Deceptive attack:** Use your skill with a weapon to attempt to get around an opponents guard. Take a -4 to hit and causing the target to have a -2 to their active defense.

**Dual weapon attack:** When you have two readied weapons you may use them both as part of the same attack action. Resolve both attacks separately with each having a -4 to hit.

**Rapid strike:** A Rapid Strike is a melee attack executed swiftly enough that you get one extra attack. Make two attacks, that may be all-out, both at -6 to skill. You can target multiple opponents this way. If you already have multiple attacks, for whatever reason, you can replace only one of them with two attacks at -6.

**Stop thrust:** If you wait to attack with a thrusting weapon against an opponent who is approaching you, you may declare it a Stop Thrust. The opponent suffers an additional damage for every 2 yards of max movement they have this round.

## Active Defense
These are defensive maneuvers used on the enemy's turn to prevent them from hitting. After a successful attack the target may attempt any one Active Defense, as long as they are aware of the attack.

**Dodge**: Your dodge skill is equal to your Basic Move + 3. If you make a success roll against this number, you dodge the attack. You may dodge any type of attack and there is no limit to the number of different attacks you can dodge in a turn.

**Parry**: To parry, you must have a ready weapon or hand. Your parry skill is equal to half your skill with the weapon you are parrying with +3. Make a success roll against this number and you have parried the attack. You may only parry melee attacks, thrown weapons, or attacks and spells that specify they can be parried. Once you’ve attempted a parry with a given weapon or hand, further parries with that weapon or hand have a cumulative -4 per parry after the first.

**Block**: To block, you must have a readied shield or cloak. Your block skill is equal to half your skill with the shield + 3. Make a success roll against this number and you have blocked the attack. You can block any melee or ranged attack, but further blocks suffer a cumulative -5 penalty.

#### Defense options
**Dive for Cover:** When within an AoE you may attempt to dive out of it. Attempt a Dodge and land prone up to a step away. Success means you reach the new location before the triggering effect goes off.

**Acrobatic dodge:** If you have put at least one point into the Acrobatics skill, you can try a “fancy” dodge once between your turns. Make an Acrobatics roll before you attempt your Dodge roll. On a success, you get +2 to that Dodge roll. On a failure, you get -2.

**Sacrificial dodge:** Defend someone by throwing yourself in front of an attack. To do so, you must be a step of interposing. Announce this before your friend attempts their defense roll. Attempt a dodge, if you succeed, you are hit by the attack. If you fail, you didn’t move in time, but your friend still gets their normal defense roll.

## Movement
Each maneuver allows for a different amount of movement based on your Basic Move. The three types of Movement are as follows.

**Full Movement**: Move a number of hexes equal to your Basic Move. Alternatively spend half your movement to shift from Prone to Kneeling or from Kneeling to Standing (for more details see Posture).

**Half Movement**: Move a number of hexes equal to half of you Basic Move rounded up. Alternatively shift from Prone to Kneeling or from Kneeling to Standing.

**Step**: Move 1 hex. Alternatively you may Stand up from Kneeling.
### Facing
Whenever you have at least a step of movement you may shift your facing freely. You must always face toward one of the six hexes adjacent to your hex. Your facing defines your front, right, left, and back hexes (see illustration). Active defenses suffer a -2 when defending from the side and it is impossible to defend from the back. You may only attack into your front hexes.

![Facing](https://github.com/HeringtonPress/HeringtonPress.github.io/assets/93562930/446fa56c-2cea-482e-b27c-1c9589aa7dd0)

### Posture
It is always a free action to move down in posture. i.e. falling prone.

**Prone**
While prone you have a movement of 1. You have a -4 to hit with melee attacks. You have a -3 to Active Defense. ranged attacks have a -2 to hit you.

**Kneeling**
While kneeling you have 1/3 movement to a minimum of 1. You have a -2 to hit with melee attacks. You have a -2 to active defense. ranged attacks have a -2 to hit you.

**Standing**
While standing you are unpenalized.
# Damage, Health, and Recovery
**Damage**: Damage is almost always ST-based and expressed as a modifier to the wielder’s basic thrusting (thr) or swinging (sw) damage, from the Damage Table (see Character Creation above). For example, a spear does “thr+2,” so with ST 11 and therefore a basic thrusting damage of 1d-1, you’ll inflict 1d+1 damage with a spear.

Each damage rating is followed by an abbreviation indicating damage type:

| Abbreviation |      Type      | Wounding Multiplier |
|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------------------:|
|      cr      |    crushing    |         x1          |
|     cut      |    cutting     |        x1.5         |
|     imp      |    impaling    |         x2          |
|     pi-      | small piercing |        x0.5         |
|      pi      |    piercing    |         x1          |
|     spec     |   see notes    |                     |

Any damage that penetrates DR is multiplied by the damage type's Wounding Multiplier. A victim loses HP equal to this new sum.

A successful attack always does at least 1 point of damage (before DR).

**Damage Resistance (DR)**: Is the measure of how well you are physically protected. Typically this is from the armour you are wearing. Reduce all incoming damage by this amount.

**Hit Points**: You do not automatically die at 0 HP, but every turn thereafter you must make a success roll against HT, with a -1 for each multiple of negative HP. Failure means you instantly pass out.

If you reach the end of an encounter and are still below 0 HP make an HT roll -5. On a success no further rolls are needed till you receive damage again, on a failure you pass out.

If you reach a negative multiple of your HP, you must immediately make an HT roll. On a failure of 3 or more you die. If you fail by 2 or less you are "Mortally wounded".

While Mortally Wounded you must make an HT roll every half hour or die. If you critically succeed on this roll you recover miraculously. If someone is tending to you, you can make a roll against their First Aid or Medicine skill instead but this requires that they be with you the full half hour. It takes an hour and a roll against Medicine -3 to stabilize someone who is Mortally Wounded.

If you reach -5xHP you die instantly, -6xHP your body is destroyed.

**Recovery**: A character with the First Aid skill can make a success roll to attempt to heal an injured character (don't forget equipment modifiers). This requires one minute and restores 1 HP if successful. If the caregiver continues to care for the wounded character for another 29 minutes, the wounded character recovers 1d-2 HP (minimum 1) more hp.

Further healing requires rest. At the end of each day of rest, make a success roll against HT. On success, the character regains 1 HP for every 10 points of max HP (minimum 1).

Characters that fell unconscious automatically wake up 15 minutes after their HP becomes positive. Or an hour after receiving First Aid.

**Fatigue points** can be recovered at a rate of 1 per ten minutes of rest.
# Equipment
All characters can use their starting money to outfit themselves. Any magical gear must be run by the GM before being bought as starting gear.
## Weapon Stats
### Acc (Accuracy)
Add Accuracy to your weapon skill if you took an Aim maneuver on the turn prior to your attack. If you have Heroic Archer (p. 35) and are wielding a bow, you don’t need to Aim – add Acc to skill whenever you Attack or All-Out Attack outside of close combat!
### Bulk
A measure of the weapon’s size and handiness. Bulk penalizes weapon skill during a Move and Attack maneuver or in close combat.
### Parry
A number, such as “+2” or “-1,” indicates the bonus or penalty to your Parry defense when using that weapon.
- “F” means the weapon is a fencing weapon, which suffers only half the penalty for multiple parries.
- “U” means the weapon is unbalanced: you cannot use it to parry after using it to attack on your turn (or vice versa).
- “X” means the weapon cannot parry.
### Range
If a weapon has only one range number, this is the Maximum Range (Max) in hexes (yards) at which it can attack a target. If two numbers appear, separated by a slash, the first is Half-Damage Range (1/2D) while the second is Max. Nearly all ranged weapons list range as multiples of the wielder’s ST. For bows and crossbows, use the weapon’s ST in these formulas (see below in Strength).
### Reach
The distance in hexes at which a melee weapon can strike; e.g., reach “2” means the weapon can only strike foes two hexes away, not closer or more distant ones. “C” indicates you can use the weapon for Close Combat, meaning in the same hex you are in.

Some weapons have more than one reach; e.g. A spear with reach “1, 2” can strike targets either one or two hexes away. An asterisk (\*) next to reach means the weapon requires a Ready maneuver to change reach (e.g., between 1 and 2).

### ST (Strength)
The minimum Strength needed to use the weapon properly. If you use a weapon that requires more ST than you have, you suffer -1 to weapon skill per point of ST deficit and lose one extra FP at the end of the fight.

For a melee or thrown weapon, your effective ST for damage purposes cannot exceed triple the weapon’s ST statistic. For instance, a large knife has minimum ST 6, so its “maximum ST” is 18.

“†” means the weapon requires two hands. If you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up), you can use a weapon like this one-handed, but it becomes unready after you attack with it. If you have at least twice the listed ST, you can wield it one-handed with no readiness penalty.

“‡” means the weapon requires two hands and becomes unready after you attack with it, unless you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up). To use it one-handed without it becoming unready, you need at least 3 times the listed ST.

**Bows, Crossbows, and ST**: Bows and crossbows have their own ST, which you must specify when you buy such a weapon. The ST in the table is the lowest possible value. Use the weapon’s rated ST instead of your ST to determine range and damage. You can always use a weapon that’s weaker than you. You can use a stronger crossbow with no penalty, but it will take longer to cock (see Reloading).
## Melee Weapon Table
Melee weapons are grouped under the skills required to use them. Skill names appear in capital letters, with defaults in parentheses.
### AXE/MACE (DX-5)

| Weapon         | Damage   | Reach | Parry | Cost | Weight | ST  | Notes |

[1] Can be thrown with a range of ST x1/x1.5 and a bulk of -4. 

[2] Any attack that injures an enemy embeds your weapon.
- If your victim tries to move away, roll a Quick Contest of ST: If you lose, your weapon is pulled from your grasp! If you win, your enemy can’t move. A tie means the weapon comes free.
- At the start of your next turn, you may try a ST roll as Ready maneuver. A successful ST roll pulls your weapon free. Failure leaves it embedded.
- If the weapon comes free for any reason, it inflicts half the injury it did going in.
- Critical failure on any of your ST rolls means the weapon is till after the battle.

[3] This attack receives damage bonuses per die based on your skill.  +1 if you know it at DX, +2 if you know it at DX+2. Claws don’t affect damage with blows assisted by weapons.

[4] Attempts to parry this weapon are at -4; knives and fencing weapons can’t parry at all! Attempts to block such weapons are at -2.

[5] Gets +2 to disarm. To grapple, attack at -4; a successful hit inflicts no damage and you must use a ready maneuver to make a quick ST contest each round to maintain the grapple.

[6] Kicks have a -2 to hit.

[7] Specify maximum reach (1-7 yards) when bought. Cost and weight are per yard. The whip requires ST 3, +1 per yard.
- Anyone injured on the arm by a whip must roll Against Will modified by the shock penalty for the injury or drop anything in that hand.
- You can “crack” a whip at -4 to hit, for +2 damage.
## Ranged Weapon Tables
### Reloading
The parenthetical number represents the number of ready actions needed to reload. 

**Thrown Weapons**: pick it up or ready a new weapon!

**Bows and Slings**: (2) means one Ready to draw and position a stone or arrow, and another to prepare the loaded weapon for shooting. A successful Fast-Draw roll turns the first into a free action, making effective reload time (1).

**Crossbows**: “(4)” means two consecutive Ready maneuvers to cock the weapon, one to draw and load a bolt, and one to bring the weapon back into shooting position. This assumes the weapon’s ST is no greater than yours. If its ST is one or two greater, reload time is (8); if its ST is three or four greater, you need a “goat’s foot” device and must be standing, reload time is (20); and if its ST is five greater or more, you cannot cock it! A successful Fast-Draw roll shaves off one Ready maneuver.

## Armor

| Armour      | DR  | Cost  | Weight | Notes   |
| ----------- | --- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Cloth       | 1   | $150  | 18     | [3]     |
| Leather     | 2   | $450  | 36     |         |

| Mail        | 4/2 | $2700 | 45     | [1,2,3] |
| Plate       | 6   | $7500 | 60     | [2]     |

[1] Use lower DR against crushing attacks.
[2] Considered metal for the purposes of armor modifiers, lightning damage, reaction penalties in town, etc.
[3] Flexible armour that can be worn under non flexible armour, with at least DR 3, to stack DR. When Layered split DR is ignored.

### Shields
**Defense Bonus (DB)**: is added to all of your active defense role from attacks to your front or shield side. This bonus is only applicable if the shield is readied. To ready or store a shield takes an amount of ready maneuvers equal to its DB.

| Shield        | DB  | Cost | Weight | Notes |
| ------------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Cloak         | 1   | 20   | 2      | [1]      |
| Small Shield  | 1   | $40  | 8      | [2,3] |
| Medium Shield | 2   | $60  | 15     | [2,3] |
| Large Shield  | 3   | $90  | 25     | [2,4] |

[1] Can be used offensively to Feint or grapple at reach C, 1 (but not for a shield bashing). Occupies a hand, and a failed block may endanger your arm.

[2] Can be used offensively, see Shield Bash on the melee weapons table. A spike that gives +1 to damage adds $20 to cost and 5 lbs. to weight.

[3] Also available as a buckler. You can ready a buckler with one Ready maneuver and drop it as a free action, like a weapon – but it occupies a hand, and can be dropped. No effect on statistics.

[4] Large shields get in the way: -2 to all attacks with the other hand (but not with the shield) unless you have Shield-Wall Training. In close combat, apply -3 for DB instead.
