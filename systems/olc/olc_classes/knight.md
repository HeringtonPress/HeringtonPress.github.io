**Starting Equipment**: Heavy armour, a marked shield, a weapon.

- You get an additional +1 HP at A and C.
- **A:** Shield Master, Vows
- **B:** Bodyguard, Fearless
- **C:** Second Wind
- **D:** Aura of Courage, 

**Shield Master**: When you Gamble your Shield Dice it is only lost on the highest result. Additionally you may attack with your shield dealing a d4 damage.

**Vows:** You may make one Vow for each Template. Vows are short, specific, personal statements that you will not forget. You must Save to break them for one round, no matter the circumstances. Example Vows:
- I will protect my friend Aloise.
- I will obey the commands of the Lady of Meridia.
- I will never harm an unarmed person.
- I will reach the Iron Gates.

**Bodyguard**: If an adjacent ally is targeted by a physical attack, you can choose to take the blow for them. This ability has a 4-in-6 chance of succeeding.

**Fearless**: Add a d4 to any saves vs fear.

**Second Wind**: As an action, you may gamble any Magic Dice you have, turning the result into your new Grit pool.

**Aura of Courage**: You add a d6 to any saves against fear, in place of **Fearless**. If you draw attention to yourself any allies who could hear or see you may add a d4 to their saves vs fear.

**Of the Emperor**: You, as a humble servant of the Emperor, get a few benefits. When you establish a domain you do so with the permission of the Emperor. Meaning only the Church can legally challenge you for that land. Additionally you pay less taxes, gain 15% more profit from any settlements.
