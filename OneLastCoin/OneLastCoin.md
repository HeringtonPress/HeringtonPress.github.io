# Core
## Stats
- **Allure** Charm, evoke manners, plead.
- **Brawn** Break, lift and push, resist.
- **Cunning** Spot, aim, wield magic, trick.
- **Dexterity** Dodge, tumble and sneak, run.

Your have a collective 44 points amongst your Stats, with no stat starting higher then 14 or lower then 6. No Stat may ever be raised higher then 18 and if a Stat falls bellow 0 you are incapacitated.
## Saves
Whenever the outcome of an action is uncertain, with success and failure both interesting. Roll equal to or under the relevant Stat to succeed. Roll over, and you fail.
### Fatigue
Fatigue is a measure of how tired you are on a 1-20 scale. When you make a test, you must roll above your current Fatigue score to succeed. 

Fatigue builds up in various way; healing from first aid, wading through a fetid swamp, climbing a mountain during a blizzard, or any other strenuous/unhealthy situation. Delving in a dungeon will often incur a slow but steady build up of Fatigue.

You lose all of your fatigue when you eat a decent meal. See "Cooking" below.
### Overexertion
Make a Failed Save successful by adding the difference needed to succeed to Fatigue. Saves failed by rolling under Fatigue cannot be overexerted.
### Challenge
Saves can be modified by a Challenge Rating (CR) or a negative number (i.e. -4). Roll your Save as normal, subtracting the CR from the Stat being saved.

Easy = 0 | Medium = 4 | Hard = 6 | “Impossible” = 8

## Class
[Classes](OLCClasses.md) are broken up into Templates which are denoted as A, B, C, and D. You begin play with the A template of a Class and as you progress you can unlock more. When you buy additional templates with Experience you may take the next alphabetical template in a class you have or take A in a new class that makes sense for your character. A character may never have more the 4 templates, though you could swap two templates at the cost of buying a new one.

You gain access to all the parts of a class when you have that letter template. For example. Laius is a level 1 Slayer, meaning he get both Critical Hits and Attack Surge. 
## Background
Who were you before your career as an adventurer. When making a save you may bargain with the Guide to add the Background value to a Stat you are Saving, maintaining the Max of 18.

You start with 4 Background points that can be distributed as you like. A single Background can never be raised above 4.
## Tongues
You know Common and one additional Language for every 2 Cunning above 8. If your Cunning is raised you can learn a new Tongue.
- **COMMON**: Understood by all sentient creatures.
- **WROTE**: Indecipherable even by magic, unspoken.
- **SIGHTLENT**: Silent without eye contact, only truthful.
- **JOTUNG**: Travels far, sounds like nature.
- **FAELUL**: Understood by plants & animals.
- **GOBTOK**: Lingers on the air for days, putrid smell.

## Inventory Slots

| Can contain:   | 1 Stress   | 1 medium weapon  |
| Bundle of rope | 20 arrows  | 1/2 heavy weapon |
| 3 rations      | 1 treasure | 2 light weapons  |

You begin play with 8 Slots and 2 additional QUICK-DRAW Slots. You gain 2 more slots when you have 4 Templates.
## Hit Points - Grit and Flesh
**Grit** is "don't get hit" points. It represents your ability to mitigate actual harm. You use these up first.

**Flesh** represents physical damage, your blood is flowing. You take Flesh damage after you've used up all your Grit--or take damage in such a way that you can't get out of the way, e.g., falling onto spikes totally bypasses your Grit and goes straight onto your Flesh.

Characters have a number of Flesh points equal to 1/2 their Brawn, rounded up. Characters have a variable amount of Grit based on what they eat (see "Leveling" below).  

You die when they have less Flesh points then -Brawn .  

If you're in the negatives Flesh-wise but not dead, a character can perform **first aid**. This is a Cunning Save. If successful, the character is restored to 1 Flesh and gains a number of Fatigue points equal to the negative value that was healed.

For example, a wounded character at -5 Flesh who is healed through first aid gains 5 Fatigue points.  

You can also heal wounded characters through magic. Healing magic just adds Flesh points, even if the result remains negative.
## Cooking
Eating **rations** and preserved food heals all Fatigue accumulated. 

A **feast** is a moment of actual rest in the middle of hostile and hungry darkness. All characters eating a feast heal **all Flesh and Fatigue** as feasts warm the heart and strengthen the body. Additionally, depending on the make up of the feast, characters might gain Grit, Magic Dice, and temporary or permanent bonuses to their abilities. See "Leveling" below.  

To create a feast, you require:
- **Two unique ingredients**
- **One portion per character**

In addition, you must fulfill **two** of the following four criteria:
- Fire
- Water
- Cooking gear
- Spices

A feast must be prepared and then immediately consumed. Leftovers don't count as a feast.   

Each monster eaten provides a certain amount of portions. A rat yields about one portion. A minotaur yields about eight. A dragon could feast upwards of fifty adventurers.   

The GM should add together any nutritional benefits from the two ingredients used to make a feast and tell the players the totals for each nutrient category (see below). Decimal totals are rounded as god intended.  

**A nutrient has a maximum score of 5.** No matter the combination of ingredients, a nutrient can't go above 5 for any one particular feast.

The GM does not need to elaborate about which ingredient provided which benefit.

**Example:** After a battle with a basilisk, the party cooks an omelette out of the basilisk's eggs, basilisk bacon, and sliced shambling mound. They cook the omelette in Senshi's wok (cooking gear), flavor it with salt, pepper, and ketchup (spices), over a fire. This fulfills 3 out of 4 of the cooking requirements.
### Leveling Up - Eat Your Way to Glory 
Characters grow and become stronger if they eat well-balanced, healthful, and magical meals. 

Each feast has four stats, called **Nutrients.** 
- **Energy** determines how many calories a feast has. This nutrient reinforces a character's Grit.
- **Minerals** provide needed magical energy. This nutrient refills a spell-casting character's Magic Dice. 
- **Vitamins** are good for your brain. This nutrient reinforces a character's mental abilities. 
- **Protein** builds strong bones and muscles. This nutrient reinforces a character's physical abilities.

Each character eating a feast may **choose to gain the benefits of two nutrients per feast.** 

#### Food Dice
Food Dice are either d4s, d6s or d8s. 
- If the feast contained **mundane** animals or plants, the Food Dice are equal to d4s. 
- If the feast contained no mundane animals or plants, **only exotic** ingredients, the Food Dice are equal to d6s. 
- If the feast contained extraordinarily **magical** ingredients, like a dragon or an angel, the Food Dice are equal to d8s. 

#### Checks and Increasing Stats
If a player accumulates three **checks** on any stat, they may immediately increase that stat by 1. Adjust derived stats accordingly.  

#### Example
The basilisk and shambling mound omelette both contribute their nutritional merits to the meal.  

The shambling mound contributes 2.6 Energy, 1 Minerals, 2.5 Vitamins, and 2 Protein.  

The basilisk contributes 1.5 Energy, 2 Minerals, 2 Vitamins, and 2 Protein.  

In total, that's 4 Energy, 3 Minerals, 4 Vitamins, and 4 Protein. The feast is entirely of exotic foods so the Food Dice equals d6.

- Laius the fighter and Senshi the dwarrow were both injured in the battle, so they both dedicate one-half of the feast to energy to get back some Grit. 
- Laius is training with Marcille to learn magic, so he dedicates the other half of his feast to vitamins, hoping to buff his mental stats. 
- Senshi dedicates the other half of his feast to protein, hoping to get a bonus to his Brawn stat. 
- Marcille used magic during the last battle so she dedicates half of her feast to minerals to recover magic dice. She chooses vitamins for the other half of her feast hoping to gain a bonus to her Wisdom stat. 

#### Energy
The more energy a character has, the more resilient they are in the face of adversity.
  
**If the players benefit from energy:** After the feast, characters may roll as many FD as the feast's energy rank.
- The character's current Grit score is immediately replaced with the new total, if it is higher. 

#### Minerals
Minerals connect a character to the natural world and the ebb of mana. As a magic-user casts spells, their internal reserves of minerals becomes quickly depleted.

**If the players benefit from minerals:** Characters gain magic dice (MD) of the same die type and number as the feast's mineral rank. A character can hold as maximum amount of magic dice as they have spell-casting templates. These MD are held until spent and expended through casting spells.  
  
**Example:** Marsille (Wizard 3, Necromancer 1) currently has 3 MD. She eats basilisk and slime soup, which has a mineral rating of 2. This would yield two d6 MD, to be used whenever she wants to cast a spell. However, since her maximum is 4 magic dice, she only gains one d6 MD from the meal.  
#### Vitamins
Vitamins produce a healthful effect on one's metabolism, reasoning, and cognitive capabilities. By eating foods rich in vitamins, characters benefit from increased memory and logical reasoning capabilities.

**If the players benefit from vitamins:** Characters may roll as many FD as the feast's vitamin rank.  
- Select one of your mental abilities: Allure or Cunning. If the total of the roll **exceeds** the character's ability, that ability gains a check.
- A player may choose to "split" the FD between different mental abilities. For example, after eating a 4FD feast, you may put 2FD towards Cunning and 2FD towards Allure.
- If any FD rolled against the same ability show the same face, the character gains a temporary bonus to their selected score equal to the amount of faces shown. This bonus lasts until the next time you rest.
	- For example, a roll of 4, 4 towards Allure and 1, 3 towards Cunning would give a bonus of +2 to Allure. 

#### Proteins
Proteins are important for building muscle and reducing soreness after exertion. Eating foods rich in proteins promotes physical development. 

**If the players benefit from proteins:** Characters may roll as many FD as the feast's proteins rank.  

- Select one of your physical abilities: Brawn or Dexterity. If the total of the roll **exceeds** the character's ability, that ability gains a check.
- A player may choose to "split" the FD between different stats. For example, after eating a 5FD feast, you may put 2FD towards Attack and 3FD towards Constitution.
- If any FD rolled against the same ability show the same face, the character gains a temporary bonus to their selected score equal to the amount of faces shown. This bonus lasts until the next time you rest.
	- For example, a roll of 4, 4 towards Brawn and 1, 3, 3 towards Dexterity would give a temporary bonus of +2 to both Brawn and Dexterity. 

#### Example
Following our example above, let's zoom in on each member of the party and see how the feast impacted them. 
- In total, that's 4 Energy, 3 Minerals, 4 Vitamins, and 4 Protein. The feast is entirely of exotic foods so the Food Dice equals d6.  
    - Laius the fighter rolls 4d6 for Energy and 4d6 for Vitamins. He dedicates all 4d6 to his Cunning, hoping to raise that stat (currently a 12). 
	    - Laius rolls a 15 for his Energy. He sets his current Grit total to 15. 
	    - Laius rolls a 13 for his Vitamins. Since this is above his current Cunning score, he gives this ability one check.
    
    - Senshi the dwarrow rolls 4d6 for Energy and 2d6 for Protein. Senshi's Brawn is currently 15.
	    - Senshi rolls a 7 for his Energy. He sets his current Grit total to 7. 
	    - Senshi rolls a 5 for his Flavor. This is lower than his current Brawn score so he gains no checks.
    
	- Marcille the elf rolls 3d6 for her Minerals and 4d6 for her Vitamins. She currently has a single d4 Magic Die and a maximum of 4. Her Cunning stat is currently 16.
	    - Marcille gains 3 d6 Magic Dice. This sets her total back to 4, her maximum.
	    - Marcille rolls an 8 for her Vitamins. Since this is lower than her current Cunning score she gains no checks.

## Experience
You gain experience through indulging in the spoils of your quests and exploration. Gain 1XP for every Gold Piece (GP) spent.

| Level |  EXP  | Templates | Slots |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:|
|   1   |   -   |     1     |   8   |
|   2   | 2000  |     2     |   8   |
|   3   | 4000  |     3     |  10   |
|   4   | 6000  |     4     |  10   |
|  5+   | +4000 |           |  12   |

## Exploring
### Watches
Days spent Traveling are split into 6 Watches. Your Guide rolls an Omen each Watch and an Omen rolled twice in a journey becomes an Encounter.
### Actions
**MOVE** a hex and see all non-hidden features in it. Receiving Stress based on the difficulty of the terrain.

Easy = 0 | Neutral = 1 | Difficult = 2 | Treacherous = 3

**SEARCH** a hex. 2-6 chance for each hidden feature of the Hex. 4-6 with direction.

**CONFRONT** an Omen or roll a new encounter.

**MAKE CAMP**. Watches taken in camps don’t roll Omens.

**SLEEP** for 2 watches, removing all Stress. Going a day without sleep gets you one fewer watch the next day.
### Mounts & Vehicles
Mounts and Vehicles reduces Stress from moving by 1.

Vehicles moving through Difficult or worse terrain have a 1-6 chance of breaking, which requires a Watch to fix.
## Delving
### The Underclock
It starts at 20 when you walk into a dungeon.  When it reaches 0, an Encounter happens.

You will periodically roll a six-sided Underworld die and subtract it from the Underclock whenever the party expends time or noise.  Examples of actions that provoke an Underclock Roll:
- Exploring a new room (including long hallways).
- Moving through 3 already-explored rooms.
- Lingering or searches.
- Making noise (e.g. kicking down a door).

NOTE: the noise of combat doesn't normally contribute to the Underclock.

Some more facts about the Underclock:
- The Underworld Die drains the party. If you get the maximum value (e.g. a _6_ on a d6), everyone in the party gains 1 fatigue.
- If the Underclock drops below 0, an Encounter is triggered.  After the Encounter resolves, the Underclock resets to 20.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 0 exactly, it resets to 3.  The Underworld's attention is elsewhere, momentarily.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 3, a Omen occurs.
### Resting
You can rest at any time. Whether to quickly eat a ration or cook a feast.
You’ll have to roll some Underclock Rolls.
- If you are resting in the middle of a well-traveled location, make 3 rolls.
- If you are in a secret room that no one else knows about, you don’t need to make any rolls.
- Everything in between is either 1 or 2 rolls.

Fatigue gained while resting is applied after the rest.
### Light
Light sources state how many people they provide for. Without enough light for everyone, roll the Underclock die twice and keep the higher result.

Whenever the Underclock die rolls, roll the usage die of any light sources lit.
### Doors
Opening a stuck door is CR 4 by base, though this may increase if the door is heavy, large, and/or obstructed. Using a prybar gives a +4 to the save.

Trying to force a stuck door open results in a Underclock roll.

You may also choose to break it down. This requires no save but rolls upwards of 3 Underclock dice.
### Locks
Requires Thieves’ tools and selecting the correct actions in order. These actions are TWIST, TAP, and TURN. Always 3 never 2 in a row. Upon selecting the wrong action, the lock will become stiff. If the lock was already stiff, the lock is jammed and becomes unable to unlock.

Each failed attempt rolls the Underclock die.

Locks of the same type are all opened the same way.

Some Modifiers that can diversify the locks are below:
- CRACKED: On the first action, any action taken is correct.
- WEATHERED: Ignore the first time a lock would jam.
- SECURED: The first wrong action causes the lock to jam.
- SPIKED: Wrong actions deals d4 damage to the picker.
### Stealth
Moving silently and unseen is a Dexterity Save with a CR equal to your total filled slots, excluding Quick-Slots.

When attempting to sneak as a group, one member of the group Saves. The CR is equal to the total filled Slots of the group, divided by half of the group, rounded up.
### Degeneration
The Underworld hoards its treasures.  It hates the idea of its gold returning to the surface.

Whenever you leave the dungeon, the dungeon degenerates.  Things may change, the dungeon may restock, but most critically, the treasure depletes.

Every time the players exit to the outside, the biggest treasure pile in the dungeon loses 20% of its value, stolen away by agents of the Underworld.
## Fighting
### Rounds
Each Round the Guide describes what it appears like the monsters are going to do. Save Cunning minus the highest HD amongst the enemies to act first.
### On Your Turn
You take two actions per round.

Move to an adjacent zone, Strike, trip, get in front of an ally, fetch an item, or raise a shield. You may only Strike once. Get creative.
### Attacking
Save the relevant Stat, dealing damage on a success.

Brawn for melee, Cunning for ranged.

Being attacked? Save Defense or take damage.

If you are dual wielding roll both damage dice and take the higher result.
### Impaired vs Bolstered
Attacks may become Impaired by circumstances within the fiction. I.e. fighting with a polearm in a narrow tunnel, using a knife against an acidic ooze, firing a bow into melee, swinging your sword while laying prone. Similarly some attacks may have reason to be more effective then they regularly are.

When making an attack while impaired your damage die becomes a d4. While Bolstered add a d6 to the damage roll.
### Sunder Shields
Raised shields reduce damage by their roll but splinter on a max roll.
### Zones
When combat starts the Table will divide the location into at least 3 Zones. Each zone signifying a sort of Landmark in the area.

### Weapons and Armour
#### Wielding Weapons
If no type is noted assume the weapon uses one hand and has no other restrictions. If wielding more then one weapon at a time roll both dice and use the higher.
**Hefty** weapons require one hand. Only one Hefty item can be wielded at once.
**Long** weapons require both hands and are Impaired in confined environments.
**Slow** weapons take an action to ready after an attack. They are also Long.

| Weapon       | Damage | Tags       | Cost |
| ------------ |:------:| ---------- |:----:|
| Hefty Tool   |   d6   | Hefty      |  2   |
| Long Tool    |   d8   | Long       |  5   |
| Hand Weapon  |   d6   |            |  5   |

| Ammo (UD10)  |        |            |  5   |

##### Specialty Weapons
Take an existing weapon with and establish what it was made for. When you are bolstered in that way gain +d8 instead of +d6 to damage. Ordering a weapon this way increases it's cost by 2x.

#### WEARING ARMOUR
Armour takes up an amount of slots equal to the bonus it grants to Defense.

| Armour  | Defense Bonus | Cost |
| ------- |:-------------:|:----:|
| None    |      10       |  0   |
| Light   |      +2       |  20  |
