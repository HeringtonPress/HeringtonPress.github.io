Dungeon Crawling
The Clock sits at 20. Every time the party takes action or hesitates it decreases by 1d6. If the Clock reaches 0 an encounter occurs and the Clock resets to 20.

Without enough light for everyone, roll the d6 twice and keep the higher result. With no light at all the die is also a d8.

Whenever the Underclock die rolls, roll the usage die of any light sources lit.
