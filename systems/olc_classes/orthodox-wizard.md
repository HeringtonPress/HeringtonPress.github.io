**Cantrips**:
1. Change the colour or texture of an object smaller than a horse for 10 minutes.
2. Create a tiny light as bright as a match on a fingertip.
3. Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll or turn a page.

**Signature Spell**: You designate one spell you use frequently as your main spell. This Spell has grown entwined with you and you with it. It lives in your brain and doesn't take a spell slot. It can be stored temporarily in living wood but will always find it's way back to you. You can always cast this spell as if you gambled 1d4 regardless of available Magic Dice.
