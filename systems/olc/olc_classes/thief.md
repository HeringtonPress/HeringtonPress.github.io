title: Thief
subtitle: Not to be confused with a common pickpocket. You are an adventurer, a delver in purest form. Any self respecting party would beg on hands and knees to the guilds in order to have a Thief in their line up. For a party without a Thief is a party unprepared.

**Starting Equipment**: 

- Gain a Thief Background equal to your number of Thief templates.
- **A:** Always Prepared, Lucky
- **B:** Opportunist
- **C:** Gloomstalker, Wall Crawler
- **D:** Gambler's Luck

**Always Prepared**: Whenever you find yourself in need of something that could have easily been purchased in town you may gamble a brain dice. Regardless of the result you have the item you needed as long as you have the slots to be carrying it right now and can pay for it.

**Lucky**: You may reroll a failed save, but if the reroll succeeds, you may not use this ability again this session.

**Opportunist**: When your attack is favoured you add a d6 in place of the first d4 you would gain.

**Gloomstalker**: As long as there is enough light for one person you do not count towards the total for the sake of light requirements.

**Wall Crawler**: You can climb as well without climbing gear as most people can with climbing gear. Simple climbs do not require a test. You can attempt impossible climbs.

**Gambler's Luck**: Lucky can be used until it has granted 2 successes.
