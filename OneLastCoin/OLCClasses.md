## Fighter
Starting Equipment: leather armor, sword, bow, 20 arrows
A: Parry, +1 attack per round
B: Notches
C: Quick Learner, +2 Attack stat
D: Impress, Cleave
You gain +1 HP for each Fighter template you possess.

A: Parry
Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points.

If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12.

B: Notches
Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet.

• +1 Damage
• Expanded critical range (+1)
• Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon).

Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

C: Quick Learner
You can become proficient with a new weapon after 4 successful hits (instead of 8). If your first attack is a critical hit, you immediately become proficient.

D: Impress
Whenever you win a fight against challenging foes, people who don't like you make a new reaction roll with a +4 bonus. This even works on people you just defeated in combat, unless you caused them undeserved or disproportionate harm. Hirelings get a +2 to Morale or a new Save vs Fear.

D: Cleave
Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with an attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a target within 5’. You can only cleave an number of targets equal to your Level in a single round.
