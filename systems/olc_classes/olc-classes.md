# The Classics
If the abundance of choices is intimidating or you simply don't need anything crazy. These classes are familiar, reliable, and easy to pick up and play.

# Wizards 
Wizard is a category of classes that all share a few key abilities.

### Spell Slots
You have practiced storing spells in you mind as apposed to in living wood. You can keep a number of spells stored in your brain equal to your number of Wizard Templates. Spells prepared in this way do not require a book or wand to cast.

### Spell Breeding  
You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:  
- a random spell  
- a mutant version of one of the two spells  
  
When the process is complete, Save -6 or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus for  
- every 10 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade  
- the number of Wizard templates you possess  
- each ritual preparation you describe to the GM

# The Remaining
## [Alchemist](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc_classes/alchemist/)
You are mad. Genius but foolish and perhaps even more obsessive then any Wizard. You have decided that the laws of the world untouched by magic is yours to grind, bottle, and command. You are mad.
## [Deserter](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc_classes/deserter/)
You are a coward. You fled when others fought, when others died. The weight of your guilt rests solely on your back, wearing away at your good boots.
## [Rat King](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc_classes/rat-king/)
Some like to imagine themselves as gods when they stand over an anthill. Watching them march in lines and circles to avoid their every step. They are fools. Godhood is not found in ants avoiding your wake. It's found in the rats. In their devotion. In their worship.
