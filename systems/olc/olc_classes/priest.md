**Starting Equipment**: 

- **A:** 
- **B:** 
- **C:** 
- **D:**  

**Rights to Rite**: You are an ordained priest and as such can make holy water, officiate weddings, perform proper funerals, etc. People may even tithe to you when you perform your priestly duties or when atoning for their sins. 

**Divine Portfolio:** Clerics have a set of 1-3 Domains, each with four Commands. For each Command of a domain you directly obey when invoking one of its miracle, it gets +1d6, up to your level. You may Gamble Magic Die, adding them to a miracle, though this opens the miracle up to magical mishaps and dooms. If you use a miracle without following a command the Sum of the dice rolled is compared to the *Disfavour Table*.

You begin with 3 Miracles from your chosen domains.

_Disfavor Table_
1. The Authority sees your actions as a just exemption.
2. Poor intentions beget poor outcomes. Disadvantage on all saves for the rest of the day.  
3. You lose your connection to your divine powers till sunrise.  
4. Misused divine energy sears your eyes. Go blind for a week.  
5. You must do penance. Take a vow of poverty, silence, or fasting, and follow it for a month.  
6. You lose something of personal value to you.  
7. You are wounded through what seems like random chance.
8. You are marked for your sins. 
9. You are excommunicated. Those of your faith will ignore you. Those who hunt traitors and exiles will hunt you, and find you, and your judgment shall be swift and merciless.  
10+. You are stripped of your divine powers forever.

**Evangelist:**   
  
**Mission From God:** Pick a single command. If you obey it when invoking a miracle, gain an extra die.

**Splinter Sect:** Start your own sect! Pick three of the following Heresies. You can pick the same Heresy multiple times.  
1. _Unbounded Dominion:_ Choose an additional domain.  
2. _Deeper Mysteries:_ Learn a miracle.  
3. _Upon Closer Reading...:_ Invert a command. That command is also inverted for all of your believers.  
4. _Syncretism:_ Combine two miracles that you know from different domains into a new miracle. This miracle scales with commands from both domains.  
5. _Divine Provenance:_ Pick another command for Mission From God.  
6. _Blessed Indoctrination:_ When you hire a believer with class levels, those class levels are in Cleric of your domain, with miracles of your choice.
