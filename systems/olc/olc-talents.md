# Talents
Though grouped by theme, players are free to mix and match talents. Players and GMs are encouraged to invent new talents and reskin existing ones.
### Terminology
**L**: A number equal to the PC’s level.
**HL**: A number equal to half the PC’s level, rounded up.
**R**: range expressed in zones.
**R0**: the zone occupied by the PC.
**Rx**: the zone occupied by the PC out to the number of zones indicated. Ex. R3 = 3 zones.

Kin Talents can only be taken by PCs of the appropriate Kin. Not all  have
, but no elf will ever  one.

### Berzerker
**Cleave**. When you reduce a creature to 0hp with an attack, make another attack with the same weapon against a target within range. You can cleave a number of targets in a single round equal to [HL].

**Danger Sense**. You have +4 on saves when determining initiative and a +2 on saves to avoid damage from traps.

**Die Hard**.

**Favor of the Gods**. When Rolling to determine GRIT reroll any 1s or 2s. In addition increase you HP by +2 per level if you are not wearing any armour.

**RAGE!**
You can enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. While in a rage, all your melee attacks inflict +1 damage and you are immune to pain, mind control, and fear.

While raging, you cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things. Spellcasting is not impossible, but all your spells must be damaging spells. While raging, you cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. You can will yourself to stop raging with Brain Save at the start of your turn as a free action. If one of your allies has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

**Rush**. Gamble a Brawn die to take a free move action on or off your turn.

**Savage Strike**.
