## Strengthen
When you level up, Test your Stats for improvement. Roll 3d6 for each Stat. If the result of the roll is equal to or higher than your max, increase the Stat by 1. If the result of the roll is 5 or more below, reduce the Stat by 1.

Stats can never be higher then 18 or lower then 6.

Your class will determine your Prime Stat which you instead roll 4d6 and keep the highest 3 on when Testing.
