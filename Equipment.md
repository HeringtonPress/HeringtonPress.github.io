# Equipment
All characters can use their starting money to outfit themselves. Any magical gear must be run by the GM before being bought as starting gear though really anything bought should be as well.
## Encumbrance
Encumbrance and Move
“Encumbrance” is a measure of the total weight you are carrying, relative to your ST. The effects of encumbrance are divided into five “encumbrance levels.” All but the lowest level will reduce your actual Move to a fraction of your Basic Move and give a penalty to Dodge, as follows:

No Encumbrance (0): Weight up to Basic Lift. Move = Basic Move. Full Dodge.

Light Encumbrance (1): Weight up to 2¥BL. Move = Basic Move ¥ 0.8. Dodge -1.

Medium Encumbrance (2): Weight up to 3¥BL. Move = Basic Move ¥ 0.6. Dodge -2.

Heavy Encumbrance (3): Weight up to 6¥BL. Move = Basic Move ¥ 0.4. Dodge -3.

Extra-Heavy Encumbrance (4): Weight up to 10¥BL. Move = Basic Move ¥ 0.2. Dodge -4.

Drop all fractions. Encumbrance can never reduce Move or Dodge below 1.

Note that these levels are numbered from 0 to 4. When a rule tells you to add or subtract your encumbrance level from a die roll, this is the number to use. For instance, encumbrance gives a penalty to Climbing, Stealth, and Swimming skills.

# Weapon Stats
## Acc (Accuracy)
Add Accuracy to your weapon skill if you took an Aim maneuver on the turn prior to your attack. If you have Heroic Archer (p. 35) and are wielding a bow, you don’t need to Aim – add Acc to skill whenever you Attack or All-Out Attack outside of close combat!
## Bulk
A measure of the weapon’s size and handiness. Bulk penalizes weapon skill during a Move and Attack maneuver or in close combat.
## Parry
A number, such as “+2” or “-1,” indicates the bonus or penalty to your Parry defense when using that weapon; see Parrying (p. XX).

“F” means the weapon is a fencing weapon, which suffers only half the penalty for multiple parries.

“U” means the weapon is unbalanced: you cannot use it to parry after using it to attack on your turn (or vice versa).

“X” means the weapon cannot parry.
## Range
If a weapon has only one range number, this is the Maximum Range (Max) in hexes (yards) at which it can attack a target. If two numbers appear, separated by a slash, the first is Half-Damage Range (1/2D) while the second is Max. Attacks on targets at or beyond 1/2D inflict half damage. Nearly all ranged weapons list 1/2D and Max as multiples of the wielder’s ST – not as fixed numbers. For bows and crossbows, use the weapon’s ST in these formulas (see Bows, Crossbows, and ST, p. 98).
## Reach
The distance in hexes at which a melee weapon can strike; e.g., reach “2” means the weapon can only strike foes two hexes away, not closer or more distant ones. “C” indicates you can use the weapon for Close Combat (p. XX).

Some weapons have more than one reach; e.g. A spear with reach “1, 2” can strike targets either one or two hexes away. An asterisk (\*) next to reach means the weapon requires a Ready maneuver to change reach (e.g., between 1 and 2).
## Shots
The number of shots the weapon gets between reloads. “1” means a missile weapon that can shoot one projectile and then needs reloading.

“T” indicates a thrown weapon. To “reload,” pick it up or ready a new weapon!

The parenthetical number after Shots is the number of one-second Ready maneuvers needed to reload a missile weapon or pull out another thrown weapon.

Blowpipes and Bows: “(2)” means one Ready to draw and position a dart or arrow, and another to prepare the loaded weapon for shooting. A successful Fast-Draw (Arrow) roll turns the first into a free action, making effective reload time (1).

Crossbows and Prodds: “(4)” means two consecutive Ready maneuvers to cock the weapon, one to draw and load a bolt, and one to bring the weapon back into shooting position. This assumes the weapon’s ST is no greater than yours (see Bows, Crossbows, and ST, below). If its ST is one or two greater, cocking takes six Ready maneuvers, so reload time is (8); if its ST is three or four greater, cocking takes 18 turns (and you need a “goat’s foot” device, and must be standing), so reload time is (20); and if its ST is five greater or more, you cannot cock it! A successful Fast-Draw (Arrow) roll shaves off one Ready maneuver.
## ST (Strength)
The minimum Strength needed to use the weapon properly. If you use a weapon that requires more ST than you have, you suffer -1 to weapon skill per point of ST deficit and lose one extra FP at the end of the fight.

For a melee or thrown weapon, your effective ST for damage purposes cannot exceed triple the weapon’s ST statistic. For instance, a large knife has minimum ST 6, so its “maximum ST” is 18; if your ST were 19+, you would compute your damage as if you had ST 18.

“†” means the weapon requires two hands. If you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up), you can use a weapon like this one-handed, but it becomes unready after you attack with it. If you have at least twice the listed ST, you can wield it one-handed with no readiness penalty.

“‡” means the weapon requires two hands and becomes unready after you attack with it, unless you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up). To use it one-handed without it becoming unready, you need at least three times the listed ST.

**Bows, Crossbows, and ST**: Bows and crossbows have their own rated ST, which you must specify when you buy such a weapon. The ST in the table is the lowest possible value. Use the weapon’s rated ST instead of your ST to determine range and damage. You can always use a weapon that’s weaker than you. You can use a stronger crossbow with no penalty, but it will take longer to cock (see Shots).

[1] Can be thrown with a range of ST x1/x1.5 and a bulk of -4. 

[2] Any attack that injures an enemy embeds your weapon. If your victim tries to move away, roll a Quick Contest of ST: If you lose, your weapon is pulled from your grasp! If you win, your enemy can’t move. A tie means the weapon comes free.
At the start of your next turn, you must either relinquish your weapon, leaving it stuck in your foe, or try a ST roll as Ready maneuver. A successful ST roll pulls your weapon free. Failure leaves it embedded. If the weapon comes free for any reason, it inflicts half the injury it did going in. Critical failure on any of your ST rolls means the weapon is till after the battle.

[3] This attack receives damage bonuses per die based on your brawling skill.  +1 if you know it at DX, +2 if you know it at DX+2. Claws don’t affect damage with blows assisted by weapons.

[4] Attempts to parry are at -4; knives and fencing weapons (“F” parry) can’t parry at all! Attempts to block such weapons are at -2.

[5] Gets +2 to disarm when wielded with this skill. To grapple, attack at -4; a successful hit inflicts no damage and you must use a ready maneuver to make a quick ST contest each round to maintain the grapple.

[6] Kicks have a -2 to hit.

[7] Specify maximum reach (1-7 yards) when bought. Cost and weight are per yard. The whip requires ST 3, +1 per yard. Anyone injured on the arm by a whip must roll Against Will modified by the shock penalty for the injury or drop anything in that hand.

You can “crack” a whip at -4 to hit, for +2 damage. Make this a technique.

# Armor

## Shields
DB: Defense Bonus, tennis number is added to all of your active defense role from attacks to your front or shield side. This bonus is only applicable if the shield is readied. To ready or store a shield takes an amount of ready maneuvers equal to its DB.

| Shield        | DB  | Cost | Weight | Notes  |
| ------------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Small Shield  | 1   | $40  | 8      | [2][3] |
| Medium Shield | 2   | $60  | 15     | [2][3] |
| Large Shield  | 3   | $90  | 25     | [2][4] |

[1] Can be used offensively to Feint or grapple at reach C, 1 (but not for a shield bash or rush). A cloak occupies a hand, and a failed block may endanger your arm.

[2] Can be used offensively, see Shield Bash on the melee weapons table. A spike that gives +1 to damage adds $20 to cost and 5 lbs. to weight before shield modifiers.

[3] Also available as a buckler. You can ready a buckler with one Ready maneuver and drop it as a free action, like a weapon – but it occupies a hand, can be dropped, and doesn’t allow a shield rush. Use Shield (Buckler) skill instead of Shield skill. No effect on statistics.

[4] Large shields get in the way: -2 to all attacks with the other hand (but not with the shield) unless you have Shield-Wall Training. In close combat, apply -3 for DB instead.
