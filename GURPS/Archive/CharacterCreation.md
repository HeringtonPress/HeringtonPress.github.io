# Characters
GURPS characters are created by spending Character Points. The GM will assign you a starting budget to build your character.

- Ordinary Folk [25-75]
- Heroes in the Making [75-125]
- Professional Adventurer [125-175]
- Named Heroes [175-250]
- Living Legends [250+]

Characters are defined by their Attributes, Skills, and Traits. All of which cost points. Lowering scores or taking negative traits can even give you more points to spend. However you can never receive more then 60 starting points back from negatives.
## Attributes
Each attribute starts at 10 (Foulkn average) for free. They can be increased using points. A good rule of thumb is that PCs shouldn't have attributes below 8. The four attributes are as follows.

**Strength (ST)**: Sets Hit Points (HP), Basic Lift, and Basic Damage (Dmg). Costs 10 points per level.

**Dexterity (DX)**: Helps determine Basic Speed. Costs 20 points per level.

**Intelligence (IQ)**: Helps you notice things and resist fear. Costs 20 points per level.

**Health (HT)**: Governs how well you resist bad effects, your Fatigue Points (FP) and helps determine Basic Speed. Costs 10 points per level.
## Secondary Characteristics
These are derived from attributes, as follows.

**Hit Points (HP)**: Your body's ability to sustain injury. Your HP starts equal to your ST and costs 2 points to increase. Can generally only be raised by 50% of ST.

**Fatigue Points (FP)**: Your body's “energy supply”. Your FP starts equal to your HT and costs 3 points to increase. Can generally only be raised by 50% of HT.

**Basic Lift (BL)**: The maximum weight you can lift over your head with one hand in one second. It is equal to (STxST)/5 lbs. If BL is 10 lbs or more, round to the nearest whole number. Doubling the time lets you lift 2xBL overhead in one hand. BL is used to calculate encumbrance (p. XX)

**Will (Will)**: your ability to withstand psychological stress and resist supernatural attacks. Equal to IQ and costing 5 points to increase. You cannot raise Will past 20, or lower it by more than 4.

**Perception (Per)**: Your general awareness and accuracy with your senses. Equal to your IQ and costs 5 points to increase.

**Basic Speed**: A measure of your reflexes. Your Basic Speed is your HT and DX added together and divided by 4. Used to determine initiative. Do not round off – a 5.25 is better than a 5. It can be increased by 0.05 for 1 point.

**Basic Move**: A measure of how far you can move in one turn, in hexes (yards). This is equal to your Basic Speed with no fractions; e.g. a Basic Speed of 5.25 gives a Basic Move of 5. It can be increased for 5 points.

**Damage (Dmg)**: Dmg is further broken up into Swing damage (Sw) and Thrust damage (Thr). Both are based on your ST. Consult the chart to the right to determine your damage. Note that this is a damage roll, not a fixed result, and can be further modified by the weapon you wield.

| ST  | Thrust | Swing |    | ST  | Thrust | Swing |
| --- | ------ | ----- | -- | --- | ------ | ----- |
| 9   | 1d-2   | 1d-1  |    | 15  | 1d+1   | 1d+2  |
| 10  | 1d-2   | 1d    |    | 16  | 1d+1   | 2d-1  |
| 11  | 1d-1   | 1d    |    | 17  | 1d+2   | 2d-1  |
| 12  | 1d-1   | 1d+1  |    | 18  | 1d+2   | 2d    |
| 13  | 1d     | 1d+1  |    | 19  | 2d-1   | 2d    |
| 14  | 1d     | 1d+2  |    | 20  | 2d-1   | 2d+1  |

>Example: We want to make a warrior with 100 points. Warriors tend to have high strength but low intelligence. We spend 50 points to raise our ST to 15, since it costs 10 points per level. We lower our IQ to 8, returning 40 points, since it refunds 20 points per level. We keep DX and HT at their default values of 10. We have spent a net total of 10 points and have 90 points left to spend.


## Skills
Skills govern what your character is good at. Skill costs depend on their controlling attribute and their difficulty (Easy, Average, Hard or Very Hard). This is usually written in the form “IQ/E” for, as an example, an Intelligence/Easy skill. 

The chart below shows the cost of skills. To determine the cost, find the skill level you wish to obtain on the chart relative to the skill's controlling attribute, then look across to the difficulty. That is the number of points you must spend to learn that skill at that level.

| Skill Level | Easy | Average | Hard | Very Hard |
| ----------- |:----:|:-------:|:----:|:---------:|
| Attribute-3 |  -   |    -    |  -   |     1     |
| Attribute-2 |  -   |    -    |  1   |     2     |
| Attribute-1 |  -   |    1    |  2   |     4     |
| Attribute+0 |  1   |    2    |  4   |     8     |
| Attribute+1 |  2   |    4    |  8   |    12     |
| Attribute+2 |  4   |    8    |  12  |    16     |
| Attribute+3 |  8   |   12    |  16  |    20     |
| Attribute+4 |  12  |   16    |  20  |    24     |
| Attribute+5 |  16  |   20    |  24  |    28     |
| Extra +1    |  +4  |   +4    |  +4  |    +4     |

>Example: We wish to purchase the Fast-talk skill, which is a IQ/A skill. If our character has a IQ of 13, buying Fast-talk 13 would cost 2 points. Fast-talk 14 would cost 4, etc.

While every character should have at least one weapon skill, you need more than just weapons to survive.

## Traits
Traits are details about your character and how they interact with the game world and system. Certain traits are required to establish the fundamentals of your character while even more can be taken to extrapolate. Below is a checklist of important traits you should take even just to clarify a default.
### Kin
Your Kin is a representation of your ancestry. The most common Kin, Foulkn, costs nothing and grants nothing but you are considered a 20 Point humanoid for the sake of certain spells. While other Kin have various advantages and disadvantages, nothing is set in stone as anyone may differs from the norm.

Whenever possible try to express your character's idiosyncrasies outside of your Kin Template. Even if you must change aspects of your Kin Template you must never shift the overall price of it.

An exception to this is when you wish to play a character with a "mixed" ancestry. In this case you should pick and choose the aspects of the kin involved in a way fitting of your vision of the character. The ending point cost must be equal to the point value of the lowest cost Kin Template, with Foulkn counting as 10 for this purpose.
### Appearance
Appearance is rated in levels. Most people have “Average” appearance, for 0 points. Good looks give a reaction bonus. Unappealing looks give a reaction penalty. These reaction modifiers only affect those who can see you! Those who cannot see you might have to make a new reaction roll upon first meeting you in person (GM’s option).

Reaction modifiers due to appearance only affect humans or beings that finds humans attractive.

**Ugly**: You have any sort of disgusting looks you can come up with. This gives -2 on reaction rolls. -8 points.

**Unattractive**: You look vaguely unappealing, but it’s nothing anyone can put a finger on. This gives -1 on reaction rolls. -4 points.

**Average**: Your appearance gives you no reaction modifiers either way. 0 points.

**Attractive**: You don’t enter beauty contests, but are definitely good looking. This gives +1 on reaction rolls. 4 points.

**Handsome** (or Beautiful): You could enter beauty contests. This gives +4 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your gender, +2 from everyone else. 12 points.

**Very Handsome** (or Very Beautiful): You could win beauty contests – regularly. This gives +6 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your gender, +2 from others. Exception: Members of the same gender with reason to dislike you (more than -4 in reaction penalties, regardless of bonuses) resent your good looks, and react at -2 instead. As well, talent scouts, friendly drunks, slave traders, and other nuisances are liable to become a problem for you. 16 points.
##### Special Option
**Androgynous**: If your appearance is Handsome (Beautiful) or better, you may specify that your looks appeal equally to all sexualities. You get a flat reaction modifier instead of a gender dependent bonus: +3 for Handsome, +4 for Very Handsome.

### Age and Aging
You can start at any age that falls within your Kin’s usual lifespan. However, unless you are Unaging, you will experience gradual decline once you age past a certain point.

Beginning at age 50, make a series of “aging rolls” each year to see if old age is taking its toll. At age 70, roll every six months. At age 90, roll every three months!

- Starting at or above one of these age thresholds is a disadvantage costing -2 for each threshold.

Aging rolls are a series of four HT rolls – one for each of your four Basic Attributes, in the following order: ST, DX, IQ, then HT. You may not use any form of Luck on these rolls.
> Modifiers: +2 if you are Very Fit, +1 if Fit, -1 if Unfit, or -2 if Very Unfit.

On a failure, reduce the attribute in question by one level. A critical failure, or any roll of 17 or 18, causes the loss of two levels.

When you lose an attribute level to age, reduce your point value accordingly. Reduce all secondary characteristics reflect the new level. If any Basic Attribute reaches 0 from aging, you die a “natural” death.

With the GM's permission, you may lose advantages or gain disadvantages of equivalent point value instead of losing an attribute point. For example, your Appearance could decline, or you could gain Hard of Hearing.
### Language
Assuming most characters can read and write their “native” language. This ability costs no points, but you should note your native language on your character sheet; e.g., “Common (Native) [0].” Less comprehension is a disadvantage worth negative points.
#### Comprehension Levels
The point cost to learn an additional language depends on your “comprehension level”: a measure of how well you function in that language overall. Writing and speaking comprehension are separate traits. There are four comprehension levels:

**None**: You don’t know the language at all. 0 points.

**Broken**: You know just enough to get by in daily life, but you’re at -3 when using skills that depend on language. 1 point for spoken, 1 point for written.

**Accented**: You can communicate clearly. You’re only at -1 when using skills that depend on language. 2 points for spoken, 2 points for written.

**Native**: You can use the language as well as an educated native. 3 points for spoken, 3 points for written.
#### Literacy
Your written comprehension level determines your degree of literacy in that language:

**Illiteracy**: A written comprehension level of None means that you cannot read the language at all.

**Semi-literacy**: A written comprehension level of Broken means you must read slowly. Roll vs. IQ just to get the basic meaning!

**Literacy**: A written comprehension of Accented or Native means you can read and write at full speed.
### Status
Status is a measure of social standing. In most worlds, Status ranges from -2 (serf or street person) to 8 (powerful emperor), with the average man being Status 0 (freeman or ordinary citizen). If you do not specifically buy Status, you have Status 0. Status costs 5 points per level. 

Status greater than 0 means you are a member of the ruling class in your culture. Your family may be nobles, businessmen or politicians, or some other type of big shots. You may even have achieved Status by your own efforts. As a result others (in your culture only) defer to you, giving you a bonus on all reaction rolls equal to the difference in Status, unless they resent your Status.

High Status carries various privileges such as entrance into fine establishments, access to certain traders, and more. Note that any high-Status person is a likely target for kidnappers and social climbers, and that some folk hate “the ruling class.”
#### Rank
As Status but specific to an organisation such as military or guild. Costing 5 points for each level of rank.
For more on Rank see Guilds and Organisations.
### Wealth
**Very Wealthy**: You start with $20,000 and +2 Status. 30 points.

**Wealthy**: You start with $5,000 and +1 Status. 20 points.

**Comfortable**: You start with $2,000. 10 points.

**Average**: You start with $1,000. 0 points.

**Struggling**: You start with $500. -10 points. 

**Poor**: You start with $200 and -1 Status. -15 points.

**Dead Broke**: You start with nothing and -2 Status. -25 points.
### Advantages
An advantage is a useful trait that gives you a mental, physical, or social “edge” over someone else who otherwise has the same abilities as you. Like all traits, each has a cost in character points. For some advantages, this cost is fixed. Others are bought in levels, usually at a flat cost per level.
### Disadvantages
A disadvantage is a problem or imperfection that renders you less capable than your attributes, advantages, and skills would indicate. That includes anything with a negative character point cost.
### Meta-Traits
Meta-Traits are a collection of Traits that function as one trait. Meaning that any Disadvantages within the Meta-Trait does not count against the negative Character Point limit, unless the Meta-Trait itself is worth negative points. The most popular example of Meta-Traits are Kin.
### Modifiers
Modifiers are extra details about Traits that shift the overall price. Typically represented by a positive or negative percentage. 
> Example: A creature with flight must pay 40 Points. If this flight is granted by wings the price is modified by -25% due to the risks and requirements of winged flight. Meaning a winged creature only needs to pay 30 points for flight.

# Starting From Scratch
If you lose a character and have to make a new one you go through character creation just as you had before. Starting with the same amount of points everyone else started with.

If, however, your previous character receives a funeral you will receive a portion of Character Points to use on your new character.

- For no funeral you receive 0 character points.

- For a quick and cheap/free funeral you receive 1/5 of the difference between starting points and previous points.

- For a planned but inexpensive funeral you receive 1/4 of the difference.

- For a typical, expensive funeral you receive 1/3.

- For an honorable, luxurious funeral you receive 1/2.

If the body is unavailable a token of them may be used in its place. Doing so reduces the Points received to the previous tier. Without a token or body reduce it by 2 tiers. If the funeral rites don't match the character's faith or culture reduce it by another tier.
