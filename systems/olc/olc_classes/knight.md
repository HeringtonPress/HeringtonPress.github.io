**Shield Master**: When you Gamble your Shield Dice it is only lost on the highest result. Additionally you may attack with your shield dealing a d4 damage.

**Knight Errant**: You are more then just a fighter in armor. You are a symbol and such you are royalty. You gain a background at +2 that describes your knight circle. This can always be used to leverage aid from anyone under the Emperor.

**Bodyguard**: If an adjacent ally is targeted by a physical attack, you can choose to take the blow for them. This ability has a 4-in-6 chance of succeeding.

**Fearless**: Add a d4 to any saves vs fear.

**Second Wind**: As an action, you may gamble any Magic Dice you have, turning the result into your new Grit pool.

**Aura of Courage**: You add a d6 to any saves against fear, in place of **Fearless**. If you draw attention to yourself any allies who could hear or see you may add a d4 to their saves vs fear.

**Of the Emperor**: You, as a humble servant of the Emperor, get a few benefits. When you establish a domain you do so with the permission of the Emperor. Meaning only the Church can legally challenge you for that land. Additionally you pay less taxes, gain 15% more profit from any settlements.
