# Fighters
## Slayer
You are a dedicated warrior, focusing on the killing of your enemies to the exclusion of the development of wider abilities.

**Starting Equipment**: Any weapon of your choice, Light Armour, and either a shield or second weapon.
- A: Critical Hits, Parry
- B: Notches
- C: Called Attack
- D: Cleave

**Critical Hits**: When rolling to hit a natural 1 results in you Impairing the target or dealing damage as though you where bolstered.

**Parry**: You may raise any weapon as a shield. Reducing damage with the weapons die the weapon breaking on a maximum roll. When a Magic Weapon would break in this way make an Allure Save to attempt to save it.

**Notches**: Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below.
- +1 Damage
- Expanded critical range (+1)
- Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon).
Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

**Called attack**: You can choose a particular spot on your target to strike at when attacking. You get a -2 modifier (-4 if it is the head) to your attack roll but if you hit the attack will inflict an additional debilitating effect appropriate for the location.

**Cleave**: When you defeat a foe you may make an additional attack as part of this action. This may only trigger a maximum amount equal to your templates.

# Wizards  

## Base Wizard
Most Caster type classes are labled as "Wizard". Anything with Wizard in it's name includes these following templates unless otherwise stated.

- A: +2 Spells (1-6), Spell Breeding  
- B: +1 Spell (1-8), Book Casting  
- C: +1 Spell (1-10), Friendly Spell  
- D: Master of Magics  
  
You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Spell Slot for each Wizard template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each.  
  
When you first gain a Wizard template, you must choose a school from the list below. You cannot change schools later. You are a spellcaster.
  
As you level, you will gain spells from your school’s spell list. You still can learn and cast spells from outside your school, but until you cast them 8 times, MD spent on them do only return on a 1, rather than a 1-3.  
  
**Spell Breeding**  
You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:  
a) a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)  
b) a random spell from a random spell list  
c) a mutant version of one of the two spells  
  
When the process is complete, Save Cunning -6 or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus for  
a) every 10 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade  
b) the number of Wizard templates you possess  
c) each ritual preparation you describe to the GM 

**Book Casting**
You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates.

You must declare you are casting a spell from a book before initiatives are rolled for the turn. You automatically go last in the initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.
  
**Friendly Spell**  
Choose 1 spell you know and have frequently cast. Apply a positive [mutation](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/mutant-spells.html) to the spell. Do not roll on the drawbacks table, even if the mutation requests that you do.  
  
**Master of Magics**  
Learn up to 6 spells from your school’s spell list, or invent an entirely new spell (GM’s discretion).

## Animist Wizard
- Starting Equipment: dagger, spellbook, ink and quill. You dress for concealment.

Animist Wizards are also known as witches. These are the bad wizards, the ones who live in shacks on the edge of town or castles on the edge of reality. They are the cursed ones, robed in black, who you seek when all other hopes fail. When the Church turns its back on you, when you scream curses into the night, when your very soul burns, then you are in need of an Animist Wizard... or ready to become one.
#### Perk
If someone makes a bargain with you and breaks it, Save. If you pass, you instantly know they have broken the bargain. Your spells can target parasites and unborn children without targeting their hosts.
#### Drawback
You cannot bathe. You cannot return another person’s love.
#### Cantrips
1. Transform into an oily formless creature with your face that has either
	- a fly speed of 2x Movement
	- b) 3x Movement
	- c) a swim speed of 2x Movement
	- d) a burrow speed of Movement
	- e) the ability to squeeze through gaps smaller than a human head.
2. Dim or extinguish all non-magical light sources in a 20’ radius.
3. Touch someone to learn if they have killed another sentient creature in the last 24hrs.

### Animist Spell List
1. Powerful Presence
- R: 0 T: self D: [dice] hours

You seem to grow in magni�cence and poise, and gains +2x[dice] bonus to Save
vs Domination, Charm, or Fear effects. Easily frightened creatures (horses, mice,
guilt-ridden murderers) must test Morale or �ee.

2. Telekinetic Shove
R: 50‘ T: creature or object D: 0
An object or creature within range is hurled through the air. Save negates. A
human-sized creature travels 10’ per [dice], and takes 1d6 damage for every 10'
travelled. A creature thrown at another creature requires an Attack roll to hit and
in�icts 1d6 damage for every 10' travelled. This spell will also blow open all the
closed but unlocked doors in a room, shatter all the windows in a building, or
knock the thatched roof off a peasant's shack.

3. Shrivel
R. 50' T: [dice] creatures D: 1d6 rounds / permanent
Target loses half of its current HP and loses 6 Strength (affecting the damage it
deals). Save negates. When the spell ends, the lost HP and Strength return. If
this spell is cast this spell with 3 or more [dice] against a single target, the lost
HP does not return, and the Strength damage is permanent. The apparent age of
the target increases considerably for the spell's duration.

4. Charm Person
R: 50' T: person D: [dice] hours
Target person regards the caster as a good friend and ignores the obvious spell
you just cast on them. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration
becomes permanent.

5. Control Water
R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of water D: concentration
Control a bucket’s worth of water. At one [die]: (a) propel a small boat, (b) carry a
small item through the water, (c) allow someone to swim at 2x speed, (d) force
someone to swim at half speed, (e) splash something no more than 5' away, (f)
dry something that is wet. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects. At 4
[dice], sink ships or move small lakes.

6. Sleep
R: 50' T: [sum] HD of creatures D: 10 min / permanent
Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less
vigorous than a slap. Save negates. Non-alert, unaware targets do not get a
Save. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes
permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while
sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration
becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the
creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

7. Dream Eater
R: 50‘ T: creature D: 0
A sleeping creature within 50' takes [sum] damage. The caster heals for the
same amount. No Save. When you gain this spell, if you don't know sleep
already, you learn it the next time you would roll to gain a spell. It replaces one of
the spells you'd roll for.

8. Scorching Ray
R: 100' T: creatures or objects D: 0
Fire a ray at a target, dealing 1d10 �re damage with a successful attack roll.
Each [dice] you invest in this spell allow you to �re an additional ray at the same
target or at a new target. Creatures are not set on �re, but very �ammable
objects such as candles, dry straw, or paper will catch �re 1 round after being
struck. Instead of using this spell to deal damage, you can instead use it to light
all the candles in a single room.

9. Scry
R: [dice]x100' T: point in space D: concentration
You conjure an invisible, intangible, �oating eyeball to a point in space that you
designate. Unlike most spells, you do not have to have line of sight to cast it. As
long as you maintain concentration, you can see through this sensor with your
normal senses. This spell requires something to scry on, usually a mirror, quiet
pool, clouds, or bon�re. If you invest 2 or more [dice], you can also hear through
the sensor (it grows an ear). If you invest at 3 or more [dice], you can also speak
through the sensor (it grows a dribbly little mouth). If you use an actual crystal
ball when casting this spell, the range is instead [dice] miles. Crystal balls are
rare enough that they are never offered for sale, but are worth upwards of
3,000gp. Most are ancestral relics.

10. Alter Self
R: 0 T: self D: [dice]x10 minutes
Alter your form to resemble that of another creature of your type (usually
humanoid). You do not gain any special abilities from this transformation.

11. Doom
R: 50' T: creature D: concentration
Target feels cold. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, and you loudly pronounce doom
on them for the next 2 turns (without being interrupted or breaking line of sight),
target dies on the 3rd turn. You need to truly hate the target for this spell to work,
or convince yourself that you hate the target. Even a sliver of pity cancels the
spell.

12. Curse
R: 50' T: mortal creature D: permanent
You in�ict a Minor or Major curse on the target. Save negates. For a minor curse,
you must invest 2 [dice]. For a major curse, you must invest 4 [dice]. Dice used
to cast this spell are automatically exhausted. You cannot dispel your own curses
but you must set a thematically appropriate cure or method of breaking it.
