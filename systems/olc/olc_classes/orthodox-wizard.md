title: Orthodox Wizard
subtitle: Identified by your Blue Robes you are a master of magics. Unburdened by schools, classification, or creed, you study magic in near all it's forms. As a Blue Wizard you are seen as equal parts reliable and unpredictable by your piers.
---
**Starting Equipment**: 1 weapon of your choice, spellbook with 2 spells, quill & ink, mumble stones.

- You learn an additional Spell every Template.
- **A:** Wizard Abilities, Cantrips
- **B**: Magic Familiarity
- **C**: Wand Wielder
- **D**: Signature Spell

**Wizard Abilities**: as noted in the Wizard section of the [Classes page](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc-classes/).

**Cantrips**:
- Change the colour or texture of an object smaller than a horse for 10 minutes.
- Create a tiny light as bright as a candle on a fingertip.
- Move a tiny item with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll or turn a page.

**Magic Familiarity**: Your innate sense for magic has progressed beyond that of even most wizards. You can detect something as magic by simply looking at it. This is still an active ability.

**Wand Wielder**: When you charge a wand with MD you can gamble Brain Dice to avoid damage taken. You may do this after seeing the (Sum) of the MD.

**Signature Spell**: You designate one spell you use frequently as your main spell. This Spell has grown entwined with you and you with it. It lives in your brain and doesn't take a spell slot. It can be stored temporarily in living wood but will always find it's way back to you. You can always cast this spell as if you gambled 1d4 regardless of available Magic Dice. Though this connection with a spell is visible, it's manifestation differs.

### Orthodox Spells
**1. Lock**  
R: 50' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 10 minutes  
Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door, chest, or similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing through it and then trapping them. This spell works on things that aren't technically portals (for example, a sword could be locked in its scabbard). Requires a save vs [dice]x4 to open. Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature's orifice. The creature gets a Save to resist, and another Save at the end of each of its turns.  

**2. Knock**  
R: 50' T: [dice] objects D: 0  
Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent open, belts come undone. If target is an armoured creature, Save or armour falls off. If target is an unarmoured creature, Save or be sick for 1d4 rounds.

**3. Grease**  
R: 50' T: object, surface D: [dice]x2 rounds  
Can be cast directly on a creature or [sum]10' x 10' surfaces. Creatures moving across the area must Save or drop held objects, or, if moving, drop prone.  
  
**4. Force Field**  
R: 10' T: plane or sphere D: concentration  
Creates a shimmering force field, 10‘x10’, centered up to 10' away. Alternatively, create a sphere centered on the caster 5' in diameter (large enough for the caster and 1 person). The force field has [sum] HP. All attacks against it hit.

**5. Levitate**  
R: 50' T: creature object D: concentration  
You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is [dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.  
  
**6. Magic Missile**  
R: 200' T: creature D: 0
Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage. As an Orthodox Wizard, your spell is unique to you, and can be any colour, shape, or pattern you describe.  
  
**7. Feather Fall**  
R: 10’ T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0  
If you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction to negate it. You float gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly late).  
  
**8. Sleep**  
R: 50' T: creature D: 10 min  
Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap (a standard action). Non-alert, unaware targets are not allowed a Save. Can affect creatures up to [sum] HD. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)  
  
**9. Light**  
R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours  
Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous.  
  
**10. Wizard Vision**  
R: touch T: sighted creature D: 10 min / permanent  
If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see through illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated.  
  
If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above, except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects: (a) You can forever see invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else. (b) You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes.  
  
The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6 Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from your peers).  

**11. Prismatic Ray**  
R: 200' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0  
Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes the target. Roll a d10: 1. Red. Target takes [sum] fire damage, Save for half. 2. Orange. Target takes [sum] bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Save negates. 3. Yellow. Target takes [sum] lightning damage, save for half. 4. Green. Target takes [sum] acid damage, save for half. 5. Blue. Target takes [sum] ice damage, save for half. 6. Purple. Target takes [sum] necrotic damage and is blinded for [sum] rounds. Save negates. 7, 8, 9. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one save. 10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times.  
  
**12. Fireball**  
R: 200' T: 20' diameter D: 0  
Does [sum] fire damage to all objects.
