**Starting Equipment**: Bow, Arrows (ud10), light armor, 3 rations.

- **A:** Wilderness Sense, Stealthy Approach
- **B:** Danger Sense, Taste of Home
- **C:** Die Hard, Reckless Swing
- **D:** Tough

**Wilderness Sense:** When the GM Rolls an Omen for the second time, triggering an encounter. You can Gamble a Brain Die to have seen this coming. You get to go as if You got the drop on the Encounter but everyone else resolves normally.

**Stealthy Approach**: Gain a bonus to any Stealth Saves equal to your Templates.

**Crippling Shot:** If you hit an enemy with your bow, you can choose to deal 1 damage instead of rolling for damage. The next attack made by the enemy deals 1/2 normal damage.

**True Caution**: When using Wilderness Sense you can choose to have avoided this encounter. The GM leaves the Omen checked as if they had only rolled it once. You then describe how you kept the party safe from the encounter.

**Impossible Shot:** Once per combat, you can make an impossible shot with your bow. The arrow can strike a target around a corner, cut a falling coin in half, or ricochet half a dozen times before parting the hair on a hostage's head.
