# Martials
## [Fighter](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/fighter/)
You are a killer. Powerful and efficient. Where most people run in terror from monsters that could raze cities, you ready your weapon.

# Specialists
## [Thief](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/thief/)
Not to be confused with a common pickpocket. You are an adventurer, a delver in purest form. Any self respecting party would beg on hands and knees to the guilds in order to have a Thief in their line up. For a party without a Thief is a party unprepared.

# Wizards 
Wizards, a category of classes, are masters of spells. Having spent their lives learning how best to trap, harness, and bargain with the living spells with their tomes they all share a few key abilities.
#### Starting Spells
When you gain Template A, roll 2d6s and gain the spells listed. Template B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. Template D, choose 4 spells from the list. If a duplicate spell is rolled, you may choose to keep it or reroll.
#### Arcane Sense
You can detect magic by touch and close inspection. To learn details about spells or magic items, Save Brains.
#### Spell Slots
You have practiced storing spells in you mind as apposed to in living wood. You can keep a number of spells stored in your brain equal to your number of Wizard Templates. Spells prepared in this way do not require a book or wand to cast.
#### Cantrips
Each Wizard class has a collection of minor abilities that they may evoke freely at anytime. These small magical abilities are stains left by the magic that has been stored in their brains manifesting as parlor tricks.
## [Orthodox Wizard](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc_classes/orthodox-wizard/)
Identified by your Blue Robes you are a master of magics. Unburdened by schools, classification, or creed, you study magic in near all it's forms. As a Blue Wizard you are seen as equal parts reliable and unpredictable by your piers.
