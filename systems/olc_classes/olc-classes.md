# OLC Classes
## Alchemist
Starting Equipment: 1 Potion of each colour (plus their recipe), a miniature lab (2 slots), a knife.
- A: Lesser Brews, Bombs
- B: Antidotes, Chug
- C: Explosive Infusion
- D: Greater Brews

**Lesser Brews**: You can turn monster corpses into extracts. Each corpse takes 10 minutes to render and is destroyed by the process. Each HD of corpse yields one extract (no partial extractions). There are three different colours of extracts. Animal-based monsters tend to give red extracts; oozes and insects tend to give green extracts; undead monsters tend to give blue extracts.

One extract can be used to make a brew. 6 can be used to learn a new brew with a month's time. Extracts don’t take up inventory slots as long as you have a miniature lab. Brews are a light item.

You can only make brews that you know the recipe for. It takes 10 minutes to make a brew. Brews with the throwable tag can be thrown 30’ and and all brews can be consumed or splashed on targets within 5’. A Brew lasts 10 minutes unless stated otherwise or obviously instantaneous.

**Bombs**: In addition to three starting brews, you also know how to make Bombs. Made the same way as brews, bombs are also light. Throwable up to 30’. Bomb damage ignores armor but not shields. Different extracts have different effects in a 5’ radius (2x2 squares).
- **Blue**: 2d4 damage, on max damage roll targets killed reanimate as mindless killers.
- **Red**: deals 1d6, targets killed explode for 1d4.
- **Green**: deals 1d6 damage, targets killed are transmuted into movement-blocking, writhing vines.

**Antidotes**: You are an expert in antidotes. You can turn any brew into an antidote to itself, which automatically stops ongoing effects. This does not apply to most brews that have instant effects. 

**Chug**: Through uncomfortable route practice you can drink faster than most people, especially thick and vile brews. You can consume a single brew as a free action per round.

**Explosive Infusion**: You can combine your bombs and brews together. When a brew-infused bomb explodes, its effects apply to the targets. You can choose whether the brew-bomb deals damage on its creation.

**Greater Brews**: You can harvest greater extracts from creatures that are HD 4 or higher (1 extract per 4 HD). It takes one greater extract to make a greater brew and 4 to learn a new greater brew. They take 10 minutes to extract and each one can be converted to 3 lesser extractions.

## Deserter
**Starting Equipment**: Light armour, a shield bearing your former affiliation, a 1 slot weapon, a weight on your conscience, and good boots.
- You get an additional +1 HP at A and C.
- **A:** Parry, Well-Travelled, Basic Training
- **B:** Patchwork, Fleet of Foot
- **C:** Unperturbed, Good Boots
- **D:** Danger Sense, Piece Meal

**Parry**: You may Gamble your Weapon Dice as Armor Dice. Doing so either before or after Gambling Armour.

**Well-Travelled:** You've been everywhere since you ran away. You can read road signs in any Tongue, and whenever bidding knowledge if you do not have an applicable background you may spend a Brain Die to get information as if you did.

**Basic Training:** You always add 1d4 to Saves during combat.

**Patchwork**: At the end of Combat you reroll any lost Armour Dice, gaining them back on the highest result. 

**Fleet of Foot:** When running away from a fight you suffer only 1 Stress.

**Unperturbed:** You've seen a lot, both before and after you defected. You add 1d4 to saves against fear, and so do your allies if you roll and succeed first.

**Good Boots**: You also suffer 1 less Stress as if you where on a mount, this does not stack if you have a mount.

**Danger Sense:** You have a good nose for when things are about to go south. You can't be surprised, and make a free melee attack at the start of combat at someone or something, regardless of initiative.

**Piece Meal**: When rolling Armour Dice for Patchwork, gain the Dice back on the highest 2 results. Patchwork now also applies to Weapon and Shield dice lost.

## Rat King
Starting Equipment: Icon of the Rat King, Sling, Cheese (3), Lockpicks
- You get an additional max rat at B and D.
- **A:** Rat Friend, Call Rat  
- **B:** Throw Rat, Rat Mapping
- **C:** Rat Bullet, Dire Rat
- **D:** Transfer Affliction

**A: Rat Friend**  
You begin play with a variant of Faelul called Ratspat. You can use it to speak freely with all rodents and unlike Faelul they may respond, though in broken tongue.

Additionally all rodents recognize you as the beloved rat king, and will improve their starting attitude toward you one step. This protection doesn't extend to your friends.

**A: Call Rat**
You tap on walls, sing a song, or emit a high-pitched squeak. If there are rats nearby (and there are nearly always rats) a rat who is loyal to the rat king will emerge from somewhere nearby and join you. Calling a rat incurs a roll on the Underworld Die.

Rats who are loyal, obey you because they are _terrified_ to disobey the rat king for reasons they struggle to explain. They obey you unhesitatingly, although they require a slice of cheese if given obviously suicidal orders.

The maximum number of rats that you can summon per day is equal to 3 times your level. However, the maximum number of rats you can have under your control is equal to your level, with an additional at B and D. Rats who are out on missions for you (such as carrying messages or mapping) still count towards this limit.

**B: Throw Rat**  
You can throw your rats as weapons. The rat becomes attached.

Each attached rat does 1 point of damage per turn and gives a -1 to damage on attacks from the target. A rat can be pulled off and held with a +4 Save. A held rat can be crushed in your hand as a free action.

**B: Rat Mapping**
You can send your rats into a dungeon to map it. This takes 20 minutes per room explored, but is relatively low risk. Choose how many rats you want to send in, and remember that you are still limited by how many rats you can control at once.

Rooms are described primarily through smells as well as a general sense of "good place", "bad place", or "indifferent" based on whether or not the room contains anything of interest to a rat. Because rats are stupid, lazy, easily confused, and really bad at passing messages along.
	Rats enjoy food, water, safety, warmth, and an abundance of places to hide (such as furniture debris or dirty straw).  Rats don't enjoy fire, noise, large creatures moving around, people talking, or a complete lack of places to hide.

So the map is just a list of circles with lines drawn between them, labeled with the predominant smell of that room (if any), with occasional smiley faces and sad faces, depending on whether the rats did or didn't like the room. 

Rats find all obvious exits to a room.  They have a 2-in-6 chance of finding secret passages. Even if they can't enter it, they can still detect it, and tell you about it.

Your DM will draw your rat map as follows: Get a d6 for every rat sent. Assume that all the rats move into the first room and roll all the d6s. So if you sent in 4 rats, roll 4d6 for the first room.

A result of a 1 or 2 indicates that rat has died, gotten bored, or wandered off.

If you have at least two dice that show a '6', the rats have paid especially good attention to this room, and return with a more useful description of the room. They actually return with a description closer to what a person would describe. They are limited by their language. They have names for all the common monsters, though you may not know them yet.

You don't get to cross-examine the rat about the description.

Then pick up all of the remaining d6s, pick an unexplored path (from any room), and then go through it. Repeat this process for the next room.

[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AoYdlgstvK8/Vm6U8X1cBUI/AAAAAAAAItw/peaCB_Dj1-E/s320/rat%2Bmap.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AoYdlgstvK8/Vm6U8X1cBUI/AAAAAAAAItw/peaCB_Dj1-E/s1600/rat%2Bmap.png)
- an example of what the rat mapping function will return  
- notice that they must have gotten at least two 6s on the first room
- also notice that they have an equal chance of exploring any unexplored room

You can use this ability from within a dungeon, too. Just remember that you're to eat away at the Underclock while you sit there waiting for the stupid rats to come back.

Rats that you use in this way wander off. Mechanically this is the same as all rats used in this way dying.

**C: Rat Bullet**
When you throw a rat you can choose to instead focus on impact. The rat deals 2d4 damage and dies on impact.

**C: Dire Rat**
When you Call Rats you may instead call a dire rat. This counts as 4 rats for the sake of the maximum you can command. This dire rat cannot be thrown or map dungeons but does have the combat prowess to act on their own. You can command them as a free action on your turn but they always go after you and after the enemies. 

**D: Transfer Affliction**
Once per day, you can transfer a disease, poison, or curse onto a willing rat. Your loyal rats always count as willing (although they may curse your name or haunt you).

## Wizards  
#### Spell Slots
You have practiced storing spells in you mind as apposed to in living wood. You can keep a number of spells stored in your brain equal to your number of Wizard Templates. Spells prepared in this way do not require a book or wand to cast.

#### Spell Breeding  
You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:  
a) a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)  
b) a random spell from a random spell list  
c) a mutant version of one of the two spells  
  
When the process is complete, Save Cunning -6 or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus for  
a) every 10 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade  
b) the number of Wizard templates you possess  
c) each ritual preparation you describe to the GM 

### Orthodox Wizard
**Starting Equipment**: dagger, spellbook with 2 spells, ink and quill, and Blue Robes.
- You learn an additional Spell every Template.
- **A:** Cantrips
- **B**: Signature Spell.
- **C**:
- **D**:

**Cantrips**:
1. Change the colour or texture of an object smaller than a horse for 10 minutes.
2. Create a tiny light as bright as a match on a fingertip.
3. Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll or turn a page.

**Signature Spell**: You designate one spell you use frequently as your main spell. This Spell has grown entwined with you and you with it. It lives in your brain and doesn't take a spell slot. It can be stored temporarily in living wood but will always find it's way back to you. You can always cast this spell as if you gambled 1d4 regardless of available Magic Dice.
