**Starting Equipment**: 1 Potion of each colour (plus their recipe), a miniature lab (2 slots), a knife.

- **A**: Lesser Brews, Bombs
- **B**: Antidotes, Chug
- **C**: Explosive Infusion
- **D**: Greater Brews

**Lesser Brews**: You can turn monster corpses into extracts. Each corpse takes 10 minutes to render and is destroyed by the process. Each HD of corpse yields one extract (no partial extractions). There are three different colours of extracts. Animal-based monsters tend to give red extracts; oozes and insects tend to give green extracts; undead monsters tend to give blue extracts.

One extract can be used to make a brew. 6 can be used to learn a new brew with a month's time. Extracts don’t take up inventory slots as long as you have a miniature lab. Brews are a light item.

You can only make brews that you know the recipe for. It takes 10 minutes to make a brew. Brews with the throwable tag can be thrown 30’ and and all brews can be consumed or splashed on targets within 5’. A Brew lasts 10 minutes unless stated otherwise or obviously instantaneous.

**Bombs**: In addition to three starting brews, you also know how to make Bombs. Made the same way as brews, bombs are also light. Throwable up to 30’. Bomb damage ignores armor but not shields. Different extracts have different effects in a 5’ radius (2x2 squares).
- **Blue**: 2d4 damage, on max damage roll targets killed reanimate as mindless killers.
- **Red**: deals 1d6, targets killed explode for 1d4.
- **Green**: deals 1d6 damage, targets killed are transmuted into movement-blocking, writhing vines.

**Antidotes**: You are an expert in antidotes. You can turn any brew into an antidote to itself, which automatically stops ongoing effects. This does not apply to most brews that have instant effects. 

**Chug**: Through uncomfortable route practice you can drink faster than most people, especially thick and vile brews. You can consume a single brew as a free action per round.

**Explosive Infusion**: You can combine your bombs and brews together. When a brew-infused bomb explodes, its effects apply to the targets. You can choose whether the brew-bomb deals damage on its creation.

**Greater Brews**: You can harvest greater extracts from creatures that are HD 4 or higher (1 extract per 4 HD). It takes one greater extract to make a greater brew and 4 to learn a new greater brew. They take 10 minutes to extract and each one can be converted to 3 lesser extractions.
