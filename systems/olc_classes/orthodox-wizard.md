---
**Starting Equipment**: dagger, spellbook with 2 spells, ink and quill, and Blue Robes.
- You learn an additional Spell every Template.
- **A:**Â Cantrips
- **B**: Magic Familiarity
- **C**: 
- **D**: Signature Spell

**Cantrips**:
- Change the colour or texture of an object smaller than a horse for 10 minutes.
- Create a tiny light as bright as a match on a fingertip.
- Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll or turn a page.

**Magic Familiarity**: Your innate sense for magic has progressed beyond that of even most wizards. You can detect something as magic by simply looking at it. This is still an active ability.



**Signature Spell**: You designate one spell you use frequently as your main spell. This Spell has grown entwined with you and you with it. It lives in your brain and doesn't take a spell slot. It can be stored temporarily in living wood but will always find it's way back to you. You can always cast this spell as if you gambled 1d4 regardless of available Magic Dice.
