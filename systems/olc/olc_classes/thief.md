title: Thief
subtitle: Not to be confused with a common pickpocket. You are an adventurer, a delver in purest form. Any self respecting party would beg on hands and knees to the guilds in order to have a Thief in their line up. For a party without a Thief is a party unprepared.

**Starting Equipment**: .

- Gain a Thief Background equal to your number of Thief templates.
- **A:** Always Prepared, Wall Crawler
- **B:** Quickdraw, Gloomstalker
- **C:** Great Escape, On Toes
- **D:** Gambler's Luck, 

**Always Prepared**: Whenever you find yourself in need of something that could have easily been purchased in town you may gamble a brain dice. Regardless of the result you have the item you needed as long as you have the slots to be carrying it right now.

**Wall Crawler**: You can climb as well without climbing gear as most people can with climbing gear. Simple climbs do not require a test. You can attempt impossible climbs.

**Gloomstalker**: As long as there is enough light for one person you do not count towards the total for the sake of light requirements.

**Quickdraw**: Gain an additional Quickdraw slot. This slot replaces a normal slot.

**Great Escape**: Once per day,  you can automatically escape from something that is restraining you and that you could plausibly escape from. This includes grapples, nooses, pit traps, and awkward social situations, but not sealed coffins.

**On Toes**: If you do not attack in a round, you roll a d4 as armor dice on any attacks against you that you are aware of.

**Gambler's Luck**: Once per real life hour you may reroll any roll. This is roll not dice so on a save you can reroll the d12 and/or any dice gambled.

**Deeper Pockets**: Gain an additional Quickdraw slot. This slot replaces a normal slot.
