# Combat
Combat proceeds in rounds. A round lasts one second. Each round, characters act in the order of their Basic Speed. Each player then chooses a Maneuver for their character from the following list. Most characters can make only one maneuver each round.
## Maneuvers
### Basic Maneuvers
**Move**: Use this maneuver to take Full Movement.

**Attack**: Attack an enemy with a ready weapon. A successful attack requires a success roll against your effective skill with the weapon. If you succeed the target must then fail to Defend (see active Defense below). The exception is if the enemy does not know you are there they do not get to defend, e.g. an attack from behind. As part of your Attack you may Step.

**Aim**: This maneuver can only be used with ranged attacks. Aim at a specific, visible enemy or point. If you attack your target with the same attack on your next turn, you may add your attack's Acc bonus to your effective skill – but if you lose sight of your enemy, make an Active Defense, change targets or change weapons, the bonus is lost. As part of your Aim you may Step.

**Ready**: used for any predominantly physical activity not covered by another maneuver. Use this Maneuver to draw a weapon, pick something up, or load a ranged weapon. Some actions require multiple or even concurrent readies, such as retrieving a potion from you backpack. As part of your Ready you may Step.

**Concentrate**: Focus on a primarily mental task - Spellcasting, non combat skills, or activating an ability that requires this maneuver. If the activity takes successive Concentration you become distracted when: taking damage, making an Active Defense roll, being shoved, or making a resistance roll. You must make a Will roll at -3, failure means you lose your concentration. As part of Concentrate you may Step.

**Free Actions**: Free actions can be performed at any time and do not take up the character’s turn. The most common free actions are to drop something and to talk.
### Advance Maneuvers
**All-Out Attack**: Sacrifice the ability to make any Active Defenses till your next turn to make an attack with full might. Specify one of the three options below when choosing this maneuver with a melee weapon.
 **Determined**: Make one attack with a +4 to hit. 
 **Double**: Make two attacks against the same foe, if you have two ready weapons or one that doesn't have to be readied after use.
 **Strong**: Make one attack. If you hit you get +2 to damage or +1 per die.
If you All-Out Attack with a ranged weapon you instead get +1 to hit.
As part of your All-Out Attack you gain Half Movement.

**All-Out Defense**: Spend all you effort on defending yourself. Specify one of these options when you choose this maneuver.
 **Increased Defense**: Add +2 to one active defense of your choice: Dodge, Parry, or Block. This bonus persists until your next turn.
 **Double Defense**: If you fail a defense roll against an attack, you may try a second, different defense against the same attack; e.g., if you fail a dodge, you may try a block or a parry. If you fail a parry (armed or unarmed) with one hand, a parry using the other hand does qualify as a “different defense.”
As part of your All-Out Defense you gain Half Movement.

**Move and Attack**: Gain full Movement and then attack with a -4 to hit to a maximum effective skill of 9.

**Wait**: Do nothing unless an event you’ve specified in advance occurs before your next turn. Specify the Maneuver and the specific trigger. You gain the movement of the prepared Maneuver which may be taken immediately or once triggered but cannot be split.

#### Attack options
Brace
Deceptive attack
Dual weapon attack
Rapid strike
Stop thrust

## Active Defense
These are defensive maneuvers used on the enemy's turn to prevent him from hitting. After a successful attack the target may attempt any one Active Defense, as long as they are aware of the attack.

**Dodge**: Your dodge skill is equal to your Basic Move + 3. If you make a success roll against this number, you dodge the attack. You may dodge any type of attack and there is no limit to the number of different attacks you can dodge in a turn, but you must be aware of the attacks. Your Dodge skill may be affected by how much you are carrying; see the Equipment section.

**Parry**: To parry, you must have a ready weapon. Your parry skill is equal to half your skill with the weapon you are parrying with +3. Make a success roll against this number and you have parried the attack. You may only parry melee attacks, thrown weapons, or attack and spells that specify they can be parried. Once you’ve attempted a parry with a given weapon or hand, further parries with that weapon or hand have a cumulative -4 per parry after the first.

**Block**: To block, you must have a readied shield or cloak. Your block skill is equal to half your skill with the shield + 3. Make a success roll against this number and you have blocked the attack. You can block any melee or ranged attack, but further blocks suffer a cumulative -5 penalty.

#### Defense options
Retreat
Dodge and drop
Acrobatic dodge
Sacrificial dodge

## Movement
Each maneuver allows for a different amount of movement based on your Basic Move. The three types of Movement are as follows.

**Full Movement**: Move a number of hexes equal to your Basic Move. Alternatively spend half your movement to shift from Prone to Kneeling or from Kneeling to Standing (for more details see Posture, p. XX).

**Half Movement**: Move a number of hexes equal to half of you Basic Move rounded up. Alternatively shift from Prone to Kneeling or from Kneeling to Standing.

**Step**: Move 1 hex. Alternatively you may Stand up from Kneeling.
## Facing
Whenever you have at least a step of movement you may shift your facing freely. You must always face toward one of the six hexes adjacent to your hex. Your facing defines your front, right, left, and back hexes (see illustration). Active defenses suffer a -2 when defending from the side and it is impossible to defend from the back. You may only attack into your front hexes.

## Posture
**Prone**
While prone you have a movement of 1. You have a -4 to hit with melee attacks. You have a -3 to Active Defense. ranged attacks have a -2 to hit you.

**Kneeling**
While kneeling you have 1/3 movement to a minimum of 1. You have a -2 to hit with melee attacks. You have a -2 to active defense. ranged attacks have a -2 to hit you.

**Standing**
While standing you are unpenalized.
## Extra effort
Various actions can be modified by pushing yourself, physically and mentally, beyond your regular limits. Extra Effort must be declared before resolving any part of an action. E.g. you must declare extra effort melee before rolling to hit.

**Melee attacks**: When you take the Attack maneuver with a melee weapon, you may spend 1 FP to gain the damage from All-Out Attack Strong without giving up defense.

**Ranged attacks**: When you take the Attack maneuver with a ranged weapon, you may spend 1 FP to attack with a +1 to hit.

**Rapid strike**: halve penalty for rapid strike, 1 FP per attack.

**Defense**: When you make an Active Defense, you may spend 1 FP to get a +2.

**Sprinting**: When you have full movement, you may spend 1 FP to move an additional 40% of your Basic Move.

**Step**: When you Step you may spend 1 FP to move an additional hex.
# Advanced Combat Rules
### Banter
Action heroes never shut up in combat – an actor has to earn his pay, after all. But it sometimes serves a purpose. Below, Psychology works like an Influence skill, because in the movies, skilled police psychologists and negotiators are good at this stuff!

**Drawing Aggression**: You can use Fast-Talk or Psychology to unleash taunts and jibes calculated to draw an opponent’s aggression. Take a Concentrate maneuver and roll a Quick Contest of skill against the higher of the enemy’s IQ or Will. If you win, that foe comes after you, changing targets if necessary. A tie does nothing. If you lose, he targets a hurt or otherwise vulnerable team member just to spite you! Win, lose, or tie, if you roll a critical success, your mark also makes an All-Out Attack on his next turn.

**Uttering Threats**: You can try Intimidation or Psychology to discourage an enemy, provided that he’s neither Indomitable nor Unfazeable. This works at -5 once combat has begun – but a gun gives you a bonus equal to the absolute value of its Bulk (e.g., +4 for a .50AE hand-cannon), and you get +1 if you light up your rival with a targeting laser. Then roll as for drawing aggression. Victory by 5 or more means he flees the fight. If you win by 1-4, your opponent hesitates, taking that many All-Out Defense maneuvers, but doesn’t leave. If you tie or lose, he comes after you! This trick only works while the team allows enemies to run away unscathed. Shooting one in the back dooms this option to failure for the rest of the encounter.
### Close quarters
When making an attack at a target closer then your reach, you have a penalty to hit equal to your maximum reach × 4. When parrying the penalty is max reach × 2. For weapons that require you to shift your reach use the current max reach for these calculations.
### Under water
- Default swimming speed is move/5 rounded down. Step grants no movement unless your swim speed is above 4.
- Weapon skills are capped by the Swimming skill, unless you have the Swim spell on or are Aquatic or Amphibious.
- Sw damage suffers a penalty of -2 x max reach. Thr damage suffers -1 x max reach.
- Ranged attacks into and out of the water are at -4, 1/10 range, -1 per die of damage, some attacks can't penetrate.
- No Parry except unarmed or close combat weapons, no Block (but you get DB), Dodge is normal for your move.
### Grappling
If you have an empty hand, you can grab foes or their equipment. You must be in your opponent’s hex to try this.

Each attempt requires an Attack, All-Out Attack, or Move and Attack maneuver, and is considered an attack. If your opponent is lying down or kneeling, you must kneel or lie down unless your rival’s Size Modifier is two or more greater than yours; however, you may do this as the step of an Attack maneuver.

Roll against DX or a grappling skill – Brawling – to hit.

*Modifiers*: Instead of standard modifiers for hit locations and weapons, apply 0 to hit the torso; ‑1 for an arm or leg; ‑3 for the head; or ‑4 for something someone is holding (like a weapon). add your SM difference as a bonus, in favour of larger grapplers. If using more then 2 hands, +2 per hand beyond the first 2. Your opponent defends normally. The effects of a hit depend on what you grabbed.

- If you grabbed an item, you’re now grasping it; if it’s a weapon, your rival cannot use it to attack or defend. On subsequent turns, you may try to wrestle it away. Each attempt counts as an attack and requires a Regular Contest of ST. If you win, you take the item away. If you lose, you lose your grip and must start over.

- If you grabbed your foe, your victim is now at ‑4 to DX – which gives ‑2 to blocks and parries, and ‑1 to dodges – while you’re holding on. Until your opponent breaks free or you let go, your victim cannot move away. (Exception: You cannot prevent a rival with more than twice your ST from leaving . . . you’re just extra encumbrance!) You may try *Actions After a Grapple* on subsequent turns.

If you grappled a body part other than the torso, all of the above applies and that one body part cannot be used to attack or defend. There are also additional effects:

- **Arm**: You cannot snatch a weapon away, but you can force your victim to drop it. Roll a Regular Contest of ST exactly as if you had grabbed the weapon.

- **Leg**: You get +3 if you try a takedown (below).

- **Head**: You may attempt to strangle (below).

Grappling someone doesn’t mean that person is grappling you! If your foe wants to do that, he must grapple on his turn. Grappling someone doesn’t give you defense penalties, either. However, you can’t parry with a limb without releasing its hold on your victim.

#### Actions After a Grapple
Grappling a foe lets you try special moves on later turns, provided your victim hasn’t broken free. Each requires an Attack or All-Out Attack maneuver, and counts as an attack.

**Takedown**: Bear a standing opponent to the ground. Roll a Quick Contest, with each contestant using the highest of ST, DX, or best grappling skill. If you aren’t standing, you have the usual attack penalty for posture. If you’re grappling your enemy’s leg or foot, you get +3. If you win, your victim falls down in your hex, losing his grip if he was grappling you. If you lose, you suffer those effects! On a tie, nothing happens.

**Pin**: Prevent an opponent who’s lying down from acting. You must be grappling your foe’s torso. Roll a Regular Contest of ST. The larger fighter gets +3 per point of Size Modifier difference. The fighter with the most free hands has +3. If you win, your foe is now helpless; you must stay there to hold him down, but you can free one hand for other actions. If you lose or tie, nothing happens.

A hand not committed to grappling can be used for an Attack, All-Out Attack, or Ready maneuver. You can bite even if your hands are busy. To Aim, Feint, Concentrate, Wait, or make a ranged attack, though, you must first pin your foe.

You may also perform these free actions on your turn:
• Release your grip with one or more hands.
• Drag or carry your victim. Only after pinning your foe, unless you have more than twice your opponent’s ST. Just move or step normally, dragging or carrying your enemy (who counts as encumbrance, likely reducing your Move).

#### Actions After Being Grappled
If you’re grappled, you can’t take a Move maneuver unless your ST is more than twice your foe’s. Aim, Concentrate, Wait, and ranged attacks are impossible. If you’re pinned, you can’t take any maneuver that requires physical movement except to Break Free.

**Break Free**: Attempt to end your enemy’s grapple or pin. This counts as an Attack maneuver. You may try every turn if grappled, every 10 turns if pinned. Roll a Quick Contest of ST. Your opponent gets +5 if grappling you with two hands or pinning you with one, +10 if pinning you with two. If either of you has three or more arms, each arm beyond the first two gives +2. If you win, you’re free and may step immediately. If your rival falls unconscious or dies, you’re automatically free at once; a stunned foe doesn’t let go but has ‑4 in the Contest.

If you prefer, you have other options:

**Attack or All-Out Attack**: You can try if not pinned! You cannot use any limb or weapon that has been grappled. The ‑4 for being grappled, and any posture penalty, still apply.

**Ready**: You can Ready an item if you have a hand free and aren’t pinned, but you must roll vs. DX. Failure means you drop the item. A Ready to switch an ability off or on always works.
# Damage, Health, and Recovery
**Damage**: Damage is almost always ST-based and expressed as a modifier to the wielder’s basic thrusting (thr) or swinging (sw) damage, from the Damage Table (Character Creation). For example, a spear does “thr+2,” so with ST 11 and therefore a basic thrusting damage of 1d-1, you’ll inflict 1d+1 damage with a spear.

A parenthetical number after damage – e.g., (2) – is an armor divisor. Divide the target’s DR by this number before subtracting it from your damage. For instance, an attack with a divisor of (2) would halve DR.

Each damage rating is followed by an abbreviation indicating damage type:

| Abbreviation |      Type      | Wounding Multiplier |
|:------------:|:--------------:| ------------------- |
|      cr      |    crushing    | x1                  |
|     cut      |    cutting     | x1.5                |
|     imp      |    impaling    | x2                  |
|     pi-      | small piercing | x0.5                |
|      pi      |    piercing    | x1                  |
|     spec     |   see notes    |                     |

Any damage that penetrates DR is multiplied by the damage type's Wounding Multiplier. A victim loses HP equal to this new sum.

A successful attack always does at least 1 point of damage (before DR).

**Armor**: In GURPS, armor (and some spells) grant a damage resistance (DR) value. Any successful attack will have its damage reduced by the character's DR. If an attack does the character's DR or less in damage, then the character takes no damage at all.

**Hit Points**: You do not automatically die at 0 HP, but every turn thereafter you must make a success roll against HT, with a -1 for each multiple of negative HP. Failure means you instantly pass out.

If you reach the end of an encounter and are still below 0 HP make an HT roll -5. On a success no further rolls are needed till you receive damage again, on a failure you pass out.

If you reach a negative multiple of your HP, you must immediately make an HT roll. On a failure you die. If you fail by 2 or less you are "Mortally wounded".

While Mortally Wounded you must make an HT roll every half hour or die. If you critically succeed on this roll you recover miraculously. If someone is tending to you, you can make a roll against their First Aid skill instead but this requires that they be with you the full half hour. It takes an hour and a roll against Medicine -3 to stabilize someone who is Mortally Wounded. Magical healing does not work while you are Mortally Wounded, though certain spells can heal the Wound.

If you reach -5xHP you die instantly, -6xHP your body is destroyed.

**Recovery**: A character with the First Aid skill can make a success roll to attempt to heal a wounded character (don't forget equipment modifiers.) This requires one minute and restores 1 HP if successful. If the caregiver continues to care for the wounded character for another 30 minutes, the wounded character recovers 1d-2 HP – minimum 1 *instead*.

Further healing requires rest. At the end of each day of rest, make a success roll against HT. On success, the character regains 1 HP for every 10 points of max HP (minimum 1).

Characters that fell unconscious automatically wake up 15 minutes after their HP becomes positive. Or an hour after recieving First Aid.

Fatigue points can be recovered at a rate of 1 per ten minutes of rest.
