# Character Creation
## Kin
Your Kin determines which Talents you begin play with. A number represents any talent of your choice.

|    Kin    | Talent                         | Desc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------: | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Foulkn   | +2                             | The most numerous of the races. They are amongst the tallest Kin, standing at an average of 5'8. Typically living just over 70 years they are also considered to be one of the "short lived" Kin. Despite this their aptness for learning and conquering has left them with far more of a footprint then the other short lived Kin.                   |
| Half-foot | All Five, Magic Illness +1     | Half-foots are a race of small humans that are lightweight and have exceptional hearing due to their large rodent like ears. They tend to have short lives, not typically exceeding 50 years, but their true age can be hard to discern due to their childlike appearance.                                                                            |
|   Elves   | Magic Resilience, Slow to Bond | Elves are a human Kin distinguished by their large pointed ears, and slight builds with little sexual dimorphism. They are one of the taller races averaging at 5'. They are a long-lived race, typically living upto 400 years, but their birthrate is low, and their population is steadily declining.                                              |
|  Dwarrow  | Strong, Steady, +1             | Dwarrow tend to be short and stocky, and are fairly strong, able to wield heavy swords and shields with ease. With an average height of 4'5. They are one of the longer-lived races, alongside elves, living approximately 200 years. Known for their beards Dwarrow are a Sexless Kin though gender expression has made it's way into their culture. |

#### Invent Your Own
Select or create a talent or trait that is common to that species. It should be something that can’t be gained after character creation - like climbing claws, or the ability to breath under water. A talent that is genetic rather than a learned skill.
## [Talents](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc-talents/)
Though grouped by theme, players are free to mix and match talents.

Players and GMs are encouraged to invent new talents and reskin existing ones.
## Background
Who you were before your career as an adventurer. When making a save you may bargain with the Guide to add the Background value to a Save. You start with 4 Background points that can be distributed as you like. A single Background can never be raised above 4.
## Tongues
You know Common and one additional Language. You can also spend a Background point to learn an additional Tongue.
- **COMMON**: Understood by all sentient creatures.
- **WROTE**: Indecipherable even by magic, unspoken.
- **SIGHTLENT**: Silent without eye contact, only truthful.
- **JOTUNG**: Travels far, sounds like nature.
- **FAELUL**: Understood by plants & animals.
- **GOBTOK**: Lingers on the air for days, putrid smell.
- **LIGHTLENT**: The tongue only travels through shadow.

## Inventory Slots

| Can contain:   | 1 Stress   | 1 medium weapon  |
| Bundle of rope |  quiver   | 1/2 heavy weapon |
| 3 rations      | 1 treasure | 3 light items  |

You begin play with 8 Slots and 2 additional QUICK-DRAW Slots. Items kept in QUICK-DRAW Slots may be retrieved freely in combat.
Small Items kept in a slot alone can be drawn as if in a QUICK-DRAW Slot.
## Hit Points and Grit
**Grit**: Don't get hit points. It represents your ability to mitigate harm.

**Hit Points** represents physical damage. You take HP damage after you've used up all your Grit--or take damage in such a way that you can't avoid, e.g., falling into lava goes straight to HP.

You have 6 HP and die when they have less HP then -Half your max.

If you're HP is in the negatives but you're not dead, a character can use a First Aid Kit to heal you to 0 HP. Being healed in this way gives you 1 Stress.
## Experience
Gain 1XP for every Gold Piece(GP) spent. XP can then be spent to:
- Gain an additional Talent. This can only be bought 10 times. 1000XP
- Replace a Talent. 300XP
- Increase your Max HP by 1 to a maximum of 10. 400XP
- Gain a new slot of inventory to a max of 12. 600XP
# Resolving Actions
---
## Saves
When doing anything with an interesting or dangerous chance of failure you roll 2d6, trying to roll higher then 8. A task's difficulty will grant you a bonus or penalty to your roll.
## Gambling Dice
To gamble dice decide the size of the pool and then roll all of them, losing any dice that show the highest 2 results of that die.
## Bidding Lore
Information and lore are categorised into 3 levels of obscurity.

- **Common Lore**: Everyone knows this. The GM will tell you all about this. 
- **Rare Lore**: Few know this. You must have an applicable background and must roll a Brain Die as if you gambled it. Regardless of the result you know the information.
- **Lost Lore**: None know this. You roll a Save and must Gamble at least 1 Brain Die. On a success you know where to learn more information about this.

# Cooking Feasts
---
A **feast** is a moment of actual rest in the middle of hostile and hungry darkness. Depending on the make up of the feast, characters might gain Grit, Magic, Brain, or Brawn Dice.

To create a feast, you require:
- **Two unique ingredients**
- **One portion per character**

In addition, you must fulfill 3 of the following 4 criteria:
- Fire
- Water
- Cooking gear
- Spices

A feast must be prepared and then immediately consumed as part of a Camp Action. Left over portions can be converted to rations that expire after your adventure.

Each creature eaten provides a number of portions. Two rat yields about one portion. A minotaur yields about eight. A dragon could feast upwards of fifty adventurers.   

The GM adds together any nutritional benefits from the unique ingredients used to make a feast and tell the players the totals for each nutrient (see below). Decimals are rounded as god intended and Nutrients can't be higher the 5.
## Nutrients
Each feast has four stats, called **Nutrients.** 
- **Energy** determines how many calories a feast has. This nutrient gives a character Grit.
- **Minerals** provide needed magical energy. This nutrient refills a character's Magic Dice. 
- **Vitamins** are good for your brain. This nutrient reinforces a character with Brain Dice. 
- **Protein** builds strong bones and muscles. This nutrient reinforces a character with Brawn Dice.

### Food Dice
Food Dice (FD) are either d4s, d6s or d8s. 
- If the feast contained **mundane** animals or plants, the Food Dice are equal to d4s. 
- If the feast contained no mundane animals or plants, **only exotic** ingredients, the Food Dice are equal to d6s. 
- If the feast contained extraordinarily **magical** ingredients, like a dragon or an angel, the Food Dice are equal to d8s. 

### Energy
**If the players benefit from energy:** After the feast, characters roll as many FD as the feast's energy rank. The character's current Grit score is immediately replaced with the new total, if it is higher. 
### Minerals
**If the players benefit from minerals:** They gain magic dice (MD) of the same die type and number as the feast's mineral rank. A character can hold a maximum amount of magic dice equal to their number of Templates. These MD are held until spent and expended through casting spells.
### Vitamins
**If the players benefit from vitamins:** They gain Brain Dice of the same die type and number as the feast's Vitamin rank. This pool replaces the current pool. These Dice can be Gambled when making a predominantly mental Save.
### Proteins
**If the players benefit from proteins:** They gain Brawn Dice of the same die type and number as the feast's Protein rank. This pool replaces the current pool. These Dice can be Gambled when making a predominantly physical Save.
## Rations & Meals in Town
Eating a ration grants 1d4 in any one nutrient. Before an adventure or when resting in civilization you can spend 10 gp to gain 4d4 spread how you like. 
# Spellcasting and Magic
---
To cast a spell you must have access to one, typically from a scroll or spellbook. Select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to Gamble, roll them, and add the numbers together. Most spells depend on the number of (dice) invest and the (sum) they roll. 
## [Spells](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc-spells/)
- An **item** is anything you can lift with one hand, and an **object** is anything up to human sized.
- Unless otherwise noted, all spells with ongoing effects last up to [dice]×10 minutes, and have a range of up to 40 feet.
- It takes an hour to move any number of spells between scrolls, spellbooks, or wands.

## Spellbooks
A solid volume, with thick vellum pages and a sturdy cover. Inside, special runes and symbols trap spells inside the living wood pages. Each book contains 4 spell slots. Spellbooks are waterproof, acid/fire-resistant. An empty spellbook is worth 100gp.
## Scrolls
A page from a spellbook, effectively, but with some extra magic built in. If you cast a spell from a scroll you can burn the scroll adding +1d6 MD to your roll. A blank scroll is worth 10gp and is a small item.
## Wands
Wands are like scrolls customized for rapid reuse. A wand has it's own pool of MD and can hold one spell. You can gamble these MD when you cast a spell with a wand, whether it is the stored spell or not. The Wands MD are always lost when gambled.

You can choose to invest MD into the wand. You roll the MD and take damage equal to the result. The MD invested in the wand is permanently added to the wand's MD bank until spent. This process takes a dungeon turn.

Most wands can only accept 4 banked MD and 1 spell. Larger wands, called staves, can hold up to 6 banked MD and up to 2 spells.
## Mishaps
If you roll a series while casting a spell, such as two 2s or four 5s, compare the (Sum) of the spell to the Mishaps table. Unless otherwise specified, the spell still works. All mishaps, unless noted otherwise, are permanent but may be reversed with a quest.

| Sum | Mishaps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2   | You cannot cast spells for 1d6 hours, and any attempts to manipulate magic will fail.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3   | For the next 24 hours, when casting spells you gain a Stress on a die roll of 3+.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4   | There is a chain reaction to the spell. Take a Stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | The Spell’s effects are reversed. Gain a Stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 6   | Any objects in your inventory that are not made of metal instantly combust. You are now immune to fire for the day.                                                                                                                                      |
| 7   | You are unable to heal HP through magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8   | You take 1d4 damage when casting spells for till the next day.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9   | Your skin turns a dark shade of purple, and you are invisible in moonlight. Your eyes however glow a bright yellow. You count as 2 for Light needed.                                                                                                     |
| 10  | For 1d4 hours your spirit leaves your body, which remains unconscious. You can fly and pass through walls, but not touch anything. Also, no one can see or hear you through mundane means.                                                               |
| 11  | You suffer horrible arcane burns; 1d3 max HP. You may gamble magic dice to ignore the effects of a spell on you. Compare (Sum)s.                                                                                                                         |
| 12  | The spell backfires; you lose 1 inventory slot (scratch it off your sheet). You are now surrounded by a magical essence that reduces incoming non-magic damage by 1.                                                                                     |

| 15  | The Spell takes on a physical form. This creature still obeys you though not perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16  | The nearest element fuses to you. Resist 3 damage of that type but take double damage from the opposite element.                                                                                                                                         |
| 17  | You are transformed into something weird and unnatural (the Warden will say exactly how). Others will have difficulty looking at you. If someone doesn’t focus on you, you are invisible.                                                                |

| 20  | You dimensionally swap limbs with a magical being from an alien plane. Gain its properties (ask the Warden), both good and bad. Also: it’s coming for you, and it’s mad as hell.                                                                         |
| 21  | An extra-planar deity senses your arcane power (ask the Warden which). You are now linked, and can call on it for aide. It can likewise ask you for help, and punish you for non-compliance. Good luck.                                                  |
| 22  | You gain the heart of a giant. Grow to 9 feet tall, add 1d4 to all strength saves, +1 move, and armour must be custom made (2x cost). Other giants and giant wannabes will try to eat your heart.                                                        |
| 23  | You create an exact duplicate of yourself. One grows older while the other grows younger. Both age at at the rate of 1 year per day. Your thoughts are joined, and if one dies so does the other.                                                        |
| 24  | You have become Elemental. Create a **True Name** for yourself. Magical energies surround you at all times, and mundane attacks against you are impaired. If someone learns your **True Name**, they can control you. Other Elementals will come for you |

# Bonds
---
The relationships you have with all the other members of your party are called Bonds. Bonds are noted on your Character Sheet: "I am Calryn's Lover".

Your Bonds become charged when you Fulfill them, exemplifying the relationship the Bond represents. Basic suggestions for this role-play are given in the descriptions of the example Bonds below. Though the GM can call for a Bond to be Charged by other examples of excellent role-playing, including but not limited to risking ones well being for their Bond. 

A charged bond can be spent to gain a d6 in the Bonds associated type; Grit, Magic, Brawn, or Brain. Alternatively you can spend a charged bond to heal 2 HP during a Feast.

Your allies are party members that you are professional and amiable with. This is the default Bond.
- Charge this bond when you make your Ally laugh both in and out of character.

### Adversary
If you have a significant problem with a party member you're probably their adversary. This isn't an excuse to be an ass to another player, but an opportunity for interesting and fair conflict.

- Masters charge this Bond when they give their henchman an agreed-upon payment or compensation.
- Henchmen charge this Bond when they use

- Guards charge this Bond when their Ward makes it out of lethal danger without taking damage.
- Wards charge this Bond when they get into lethal danger.

# Exploring
---
## Watches
Days spent Traveling are split into 4 Watches. Your Guide rolls an Omen each Watch and an Omen rolled twice in a journey becomes an Encounter.
## Actions
- **MOVE** a hex and see all non-hidden features in it. Receiving stress based on the difficulty of the terrain you are entering.

Easy = 0 | Neutral = 1 | Difficult = 2 | Treacherous = 3

- **SEARCH** a hex. 2-6 chance for each hidden feature of the Hex. 4-6 with directions.

- **SCOUT** the area. Spend a watch patrolling the borders of a Hex seeing the terrain of neighboring hexes.

- **CONFRONT** an Omen or roll a new encounter.

- **MAKE CAMP**. Watches taken in camps don’t roll Omens.

- **DELVE** Unless obviously more time is taken, Delving into and exiting a dungeon takes a Watch.

- **REST** Take a moment to recuperate, lose all Stress, but the GM will roll for Omens twice. While resting you may Feast.

## Vehicles
Riding a mount or vehicle reduces all Stress received from travel by 1.

Vehicles moving through Difficult or worse terrain have a 1-6 chance of breaking, which requires a Watch to fix.
# Delving
---
## The Underclock
Starting at 20 when entering a dungeon, an Encounter is triggered when the Underclock reaches below 0.

You roll a d6 Dungeon Die and subtract it from the Underclock whenever the party expends time or generates noise. Actions that prompt an Underclock Roll include:
- Exploring a new room (including long hallways).
- Moving through 3 already-explored rooms.
- Lingering or searching.
- Making noise (excluding Combat).

Most Dungeon Die rolls are considered a Turn, representing approximately 10 minutes of time.

Additional details about the Underclock:
- If the Underclock drops below 0, an Encounter is triggered.  After the Encounter resolves, the Underclock resets to 20.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 0 exactly, it resets to 3.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 3, a Omen occurs.

### Confront the Clock
At any point while Delving a party can prepare for a coming encounter. Skip the Underclock to -1 and resolve everything as normal though the party gets the drop on the encounter.
## Resting
While eating a ration is just a turn. Resting and cooking a feast takes some time.
You’ll have to roll some Underclock Rolls.
- If you are resting in the middle of a well-traveled location, make 3 rolls.
- If you are in a secret room that no one else knows about, you don’t need to make any rolls.
- Everything in between is either 1 or 2 rolls.

## Light
Light sources state how many people they provide for. Without enough light for everyone, roll the Underclock die twice and keep the higher result. With no light at all the die size is also increased.

Whenever the Underclock die rolls, roll the usage die of any light sources lit.
## Doors
Prying open a door is a -4 save, though this may increase if the door is heavy, large, and/or obstructed. Using a prybar gives a +4 to the save.

You may also choose to break it down. This requires no save but rolls upwards of 3 Underclock dice.
## Locks
Requires lockpicks and selecting the correct actions in order. These actions are TWIST, TAP, and TURN. Always 3 never 2 in a row. Upon selecting the wrong action, the lock will become stiff. If the lock was already stiff, the lock is jammed and becomes unable to unlock.

Each failed attempt rolls the Underclock die.

Locks of the same type are all opened the same way.

Some Modifiers that can diversify the locks are below:
- CRACKED: On the first action, any action taken is correct.
- WEATHERED: Ignore the first time a lock would jam.
- SECURED: The first wrong action causes the lock to jam.
- SPIKED: Wrong actions deals d4 damage to the picker.

## Stealth
Moving silently and unseen is a Save with a bonus equal to your empty slots and a penalty equal to the amount of armor filled slots.

When sneaking as a group one save is made with the penalty and bonuses averaged.
## Degeneration and Leaving the Dungeon
Every time you leave the Dungeon, the biggest treasure pile in the dungeon loses around 20% of its value, stolen away by agents of the Underworld.

The exception to this is if you have a camp setup outside the dungeon you may make a pitstop. Roll the Dungeon die once when exciting and again when re-entering though these rolls may never lower the clock beyond 3.
# Fighting
---
## Hands
All combat actions are broken up into 3 hands. Rock●, Paper□, and Scissors<. When fighting with an enemy you will each throw out an ability, comparing the hands to assess effectiveness. This respects the law of Rock● beats Paper□ beats Scissors< beats Rock●. With a tie being when 2 of the same hand are thrown.
## Stances
Actions are also divided between two Stances; Offensive† and Defensive‡. Offensive† is the typical Stance. It targets an enemy and defends from that same enemy. The Defensive‡ Stance targets only one enemy but defends from all.
## Zones
There are 4 zones in a typical combat encounter. These are Forward↑ and Rearward↓ for allies and enemies. Certain combat actions are also divided into Forward and Rearward, meaning they can only be used while in those Zones. If an ability doesn't specify a zone it can be used in any↕.
![Zone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeringtonPress/HeringtonPress.github.io/master/assets/img/Zone.png)
Combatants in Forward are paired together with the most numerous group in Forward deciding the pairings. Leaving anyone left over to choose their own target. While combatants in Rearward may target whoever they choose.
If a sides Forward is empty then everyone on that sides Rearward is considered to be Forward.
## Basic Actions
Everyone has access to the following Actions.
- Attack (●□<) † ↕
	- Deal 4 damage on a win, or 2 on a tie.
- Defend (●□<) ‡ ↕
	- Deal 2 damage on a win.

## Conditions
There are 3 Conditions Stoned Folded and Dulled. Each one is associated with a Hand. Stoned to Rock●, Folded to Paper□, and Dulled to Scissors<. While afflicted with one of these Conditions you cannot throw that respective Hand. Unless stated otherwise you recover from a condition after one round.
## Fleeing
If the party agrees to retreat then bar dire circumstances they escape. Each character that escaped gains 2d3 Stress. Any items dropped in the pursuit are lost to the dungeon. Fleeing in this way leaves any fallen or captured ally behind, unless you are holding the fallen and have the slots to do so. The average human is 6 Slots and dragging allows you to ignore their encumbrance.
