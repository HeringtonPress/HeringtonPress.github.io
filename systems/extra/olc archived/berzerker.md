**Rage**  
You can enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. While in a rage, all your melee attacks inflict +1 damage and you are immune to pain, mind control, and fear.

While raging, you cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things. Spellcasting is not impossible, but all your spells must be damaging spells. While raging, you cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. You can will yourself to stop raging with save at the start of your turn as a free action. If one of your allies has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.  
  
**Danger Sense**  
Add double your empty slots to initiative. If ambushed you still roll as if initiative though get no bonus for slots.
  
**A Taste of Home**  
You can consume a special "dose" to regain 1d4+1 HP. This takes 1 action and is a small item. One use costs 3gp and can be purchased in any trading city. You cannot do this while raging, but you can immediately enter a rage after eating the dose. For 10 minutes after eating a dose you add 1d6 to all Strength Saves.

**Die Hard**

**Reckless Swing**: While Raging you can Gamble Brawn dice. Adding the Result and the amount of Dice gambled to the damage of an attack.
