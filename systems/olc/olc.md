## [Class](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc-classes/)
Divided into Templates denoted as A, B, C, and D. You begin play with the A template of a Class. When you level up you take the next numerical template in a class or take A in a new class. You may never have more the 4 templates, though you can swap two templates when leveling up.

## Background
Who you were before your career as an adventurer. When making a save you may bargain with the Guide to add the Background value to a Save. You start with 4 Background points that can be distributed as you like. A single Background can never be raised above 4.
## Tongues
You know Common and one additional Language. You can also spend a Background point to learn an additional Tongue.
- **COMMON**: Understood by all sentient creatures.
- **WROTE**: Indecipherable even by magic, unspoken.
- **SIGHTLENT**: Silent without eye contact, only truthful.
- **JOTUNG**: Travels far, sounds like nature.
- **FAELUL**: Understood by plants & animals.
- **GOBTOK**: Lingers on the air for days, putrid smell.
- **LIGHTLENT**: The tongue only travels through shadow.

## Inventory Slots

| Can contain:   | 1 Stress   | 1 medium weapon  |
| Bundle of rope |  quiver   | 1/2 heavy weapon |
| 3 rations      | 1 treasure | 3 light items  |

You begin play with 10 Slots and 2 additional QUICK-DRAW Slots. Gaining additional Slots as you level. Small Items kept in a slot alone can be drawn as if in a QUICK-DRAW Slot.
## Hit Points and Grit
**Grit**: Don't get hit points. It represents your ability to mitigate harm.

**Hit Points** represents physical damage. You take HP damage after you've used up all your Grit--or take damage in such a way that you can't avoid, e.g., falling into lava goes straight to HP.

You have 6 HP and die when they have less HP then -Half your max.

If you're HP is in the negatives but you're not dead, a character can use a First Aid Kit to heal you to 0 HP. Being healed in this way gives you 1 Stress.
## Experience
Gain 1XP for every Gold Piece (GP) spent.

| Level |  EXP  | Templates | Slots |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:|
|   1   |   -   |     1     |  10   |
|   2   | 2000  |     2     |  11   |
|   3   | 4000  |     3     |  12   |
|   4   | 6000  |     4     |  13   |
|  5+   | +4000 |           |  14   |

# Resolving Actions
---
## Saves
When doing anything with an interesting or dangerous chance of failure you roll a d12, trying to roll higher then 8. A tasks difficulty may grant you a bonus or penalty to your roll.
## Gambling Dice
To gamble dice decide the size of the pool and then roll all of them, losing any dice that show the highest 2 results of that die.
## Bid Lore
Information and lore are categorised into 3 levels of obscurity.

- **Common Lore**: Everyone knows this. The GM will tell you all about this. 
- **Rare Lore**: Few know this. You must have an applicable background and must roll a Brain Die as if you gambled it. Regardless of the result you know the information.
- **Lost Lore**: None know this. You roll a Save and must Gamble at least 1 Brain Die. On a success you know where to learn more information about this.

# Cooking Feasts
---
A **feast** is a moment of actual rest in the middle of hostile and hungry darkness. Depending on the make up of the feast, characters might gain Grit, Magic, Brain, or Brawn Dice.

To create a feast, you require:
- **Two unique ingredients**
- **One portion per character**

In addition, you must fulfill 3 of the following 4 criteria:
- Fire
- Water
- Cooking gear
- Spices

A feast must be prepared and then immediately consumed as part of a Camp Action. Left over portions can be converted to rations that expire after your adventure.

Each creature eaten provides a number of portions. Two rat yields about one portion. A minotaur yields about eight. A dragon could feast upwards of fifty adventurers.   

The GM adds together any nutritional benefits from the unique ingredients used to make a feast and tell the players the totals for each nutrient (see below). Decimals are rounded as god intended and Nutrients can't be higher the 5.
## Nutrients
Each feast has four stats, called **Nutrients.** 
- **Energy** determines how many calories a feast has. This nutrient gives a character Grit.
- **Minerals** provide needed magical energy. This nutrient refills a character's Magic Dice. 
- **Vitamins** are good for your brain. This nutrient reinforces a character with Brain Dice. 
- **Protein** builds strong bones and muscles. This nutrient reinforces a character with Brawn Dice.

### Food Dice
Food Dice (FD) are either d4s, d6s or d8s. 
- If the feast contained **mundane** animals or plants, the Food Dice are equal to d4s. 
- If the feast contained no mundane animals or plants, **only exotic** ingredients, the Food Dice are equal to d6s. 
- If the feast contained extraordinarily **magical** ingredients, like a dragon or an angel, the Food Dice are equal to d8s. 

### Energy
**If the players benefit from energy:** After the feast, characters roll as many FD as the feast's energy rank. The character's current Grit score is immediately replaced with the new total, if it is higher. 
### Minerals
**If the players benefit from minerals:** They gain magic dice (MD) of the same die type and number as the feast's mineral rank. A character can hold a maximum amount of magic dice equal to their number of Templates. These MD are held until spent and expended through casting spells.
### Vitamins
**If the players benefit from vitamins:** They gain Brain Dice of the same die type and number as the feast's Vitamin rank. This pool replaces the current pool. These Dice can be Gambled when making a predominantly mental Save.
### Proteins
**If the players benefit from proteins:** They gain Brawn Dice of the same die type and number as the feast's Protein rank. This pool replaces the current pool. These Dice can be Gambled when making a predominantly physical Save.
## Rations & Meals in Town
Eating a ration grants 1d4 in any one nutrient. Before an adventure or when resting in civilization you can spend 10 gp to gain 4d4 spread how you like. 
# Spellcasting and Magic
---
To cast a spell you must have access to one, typically from a scroll or spellbook. Select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to Gamble, roll them, and add the numbers together. Most spells depend on the number of (dice) invest and the (sum) they roll. 
## [Spells](https://heringtonpress.github.io/systems/olc/olc-spells/)
- An **item** is anything you can lift with one hand, and an **object** is anything up to human sized.
- Unless otherwise noted, all spells with ongoing effects last up to [dice]×10 minutes, and have a range of up to 40 feet.
- It takes an hour to move any number of spells between scrolls, spellbooks, or wands.

## Spellbooks
A solid volume, with thick vellum pages and a sturdy cover. Inside, special runes and symbols trap spells inside the living wood pages. Each book contains 4 spell slots. Spellbooks are waterproof, acid/fire-resistant. An empty spellbook is worth 100gp.
## Scrolls
A page from a spellbook, effectively, but with some extra magic built in. If you cast a spell from a scroll you can burn the scroll adding +1d6 MD to your roll. A blank scroll is worth 10gp and is a small item.
## Wands
Wands are like scrolls customized for rapid reuse. A wand has it's own pool of MD and can hold one spell. You can gamble these MD when you cast a spell with a wand, whether it is the stored spell or not. The Wands MD are always lost when gambled.

You can choose to invest MD into the wand. You roll the MD and take damage equal to the result. The MD invested in the wand is permanently added to the wand's MD bank until spent. This process takes a dungeon turn.

Most wands can only accept 4 banked MD and 1 spell. Larger wands, called staves, can hold up to 6 banked MD and up to 2 spells.
## Mishaps
If you roll a series while casting a spell, such as two 2s or four 5s, compare the (Sum) of the spell to the Mishaps table. Unless otherwise specified, the spell still works. All mishaps, unless noted otherwise, are permanent but may be reversed with a quest.

| Sum | Mishaps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2   | You cannot cast spells for 1d6 hours, and any attempts to manipulate magic will fail.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3   | For the next 24 hours, when casting spells you gain a Stress on a die roll of 3+.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4   | There is a chain reaction to the spell. Take a Stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | The Spell’s effects are reversed. Gain a Stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 6   | Any objects in your inventory that are not made of metal instantly combust. You are now immune to fire for the day.                                                                                                                                      |
| 7   | You are unable to heal HP through magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8   | You take 1d4 damage when casting spells for till the next day.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9   | Your skin turns a dark shade of purple, and you are invisible in moonlight. Your eyes however glow a bright yellow. You count as 2 for Light needed.                                                                                                     |
| 10  | For 1d4 hours your spirit leaves your body, which remains unconscious. You can fly and pass through walls, but not touch anything. Also, no one can see or hear you through mundane means.                                                               |
| 11  | You suffer horrible arcane burns; 1d3 max HP. You may gamble magic dice to ignore the effects of a spell on you. Compare (Sum)s.                                                                                                                         |
| 12  | The spell backfires; you lose 1 inventory slot (scratch it off your sheet). You are now surrounded by a magical essence that reduces incoming non-magic damage by 1.                                                                                     |
| 13  | The Spell escapes it's prison. Unbound it causes a little chaos before disappearing.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 14  | The Spells effects leak into you. Gain a magical mutation.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 15  | The Spell takes on a physical form. This creature still obeys you though not perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16  | The nearest element fuses to you. Resist 3 damage of that type but take double damage from the opposite element.                                                                                                                                         |
| 17  | You are transformed into something weird and unnatural (the Warden will say exactly how). Others will have difficulty looking at you. If someone doesn’t focus on you, you are invisible.                                                                |
| 18  | Your hands fuse with whatever you are holding. Fusing shut if empty.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 19  | Large ugly wings sprout from your back, ripping through whatever you are wearing. You can fly but you cannot wear armor or a backpack, and such have only 5 inventory slots.                                                                             |
| 20  | You dimensionally swap limbs with a magical being from an alien plane. Gain its properties (ask the Warden), both good and bad. Also: it’s coming for you, and it’s mad as hell.                                                                         |
| 21  | An extra-planar deity senses your arcane power (ask the Warden which). You are now linked, and can call on it for aide. It can likewise ask you for help, and punish you for non-compliance. Good luck.                                                  |
| 22  | You gain the heart of a giant. Grow to 9 feet tall, add 1d4 to all strength saves, +1 move, and armour must be custom made (2x cost). Other giants and giant wannabes will try to eat your heart.                                                        |
| 23  | You create an exact duplicate of yourself. One grows older while the other grows younger. Both age at at the rate of 1 year per day. Your thoughts are joined, and if one dies so does the other.                                                        |
| 24  | You have become Elemental. Create a **True Name** for yourself. Magical energies surround you at all times, and mundane attacks against you are impaired. If someone learns your **True Name**, they can control you. Other Elementals will come for you |

# Exploring
---
## Watches
Days spent Traveling are split into 4 Watches. Your Guide rolls an Omen each Watch and an Omen rolled twice in a journey becomes an Encounter.
## Actions
- **MOVE** a hex and see all non-hidden features in it. Receiving stress based on the difficulty of the terrain you are entering.

Easy = 0 | Neutral = 1 | Difficult = 2 | Treacherous = 3

- **SEARCH** a hex. 2-6 chance for each hidden feature of the Hex. 4-6 with directions.

- **SCOUT** the area. Spend a watch patrolling the borders of a Hex seeing the terrain of neighboring hexes.

- **CONFRONT** an Omen or roll a new encounter.

- **MAKE CAMP**. Watches taken in camps don’t roll Omens.

- **DELVE** Unless obviously more time is taken, Delving into and exiting a dungeon takes a Watch.

- **REST** Take a moment to recuperate, lose all Stress, but the GM will roll for Omens twice. While resting you could Feast.
## Vehicles
Riding a mount or vehicle reduces all Stress received from travel by 1.

Vehicles moving through Difficult or worse terrain have a 1-6 chance of breaking, which requires a Watch to fix.
# Delving
---
## The Underclock
Starting at 20 when entering a dungeon, an Encounter is triggered when the Underclock reaches below 0.

You roll a d6 Dungeon Die and subtract it from the Underclock whenever the party expends time or generates noise. Actions that prompt an Underclock Roll include:
- Exploring a new room (including long hallways).
- Moving through 3 already-explored rooms.
- Lingering or searching.
- Making noise (excluding Combat).

Most Dungeon Die rolls are considered a Turn, representing approximately 10 minutes of time.

Additional details about the Underclock:
- If the Underclock drops below 0, an Encounter is triggered.  After the Encounter resolves, the Underclock resets to 20.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 0 exactly, it resets to 3.
- If the Underworld Clock equals 3, a Omen occurs.

### Confront the Clock
At any point while Delving a party can prepare for a coming encounter. Skip the Underclock to -1 and resolve everything as normal though the party gets the drop on the encounter.
## Resting
While eating a ration is just a turn. Resting and cooking a feast takes some time.
You’ll have to roll some Underclock Rolls.
- If you are resting in the middle of a well-traveled location, make 3 rolls.
- If you are in a secret room that no one else knows about, you don’t need to make any rolls.
- Everything in between is either 1 or 2 rolls.

## Light
Light sources state how many people they provide for. Without enough light for everyone, roll the Underclock die twice and keep the higher result. With no light at all the die size is also increased.

Whenever the Underclock die rolls, roll the usage die of any light sources lit.
## Doors
Prying open a door is a -4 save, though this may increase if the door is heavy, large, and/or obstructed. Using a prybar gives a +4 to the save.

You may also choose to break it down. This requires no save but rolls upwards of 3 Underclock dice.
## Locks
Requires lockpicks and selecting the correct actions in order. These actions are TWIST, TAP, and TURN. Always 3 never 2 in a row. Upon selecting the wrong action, the lock will become stiff. If the lock was already stiff, the lock is jammed and becomes unable to unlock.

Each failed attempt rolls the Underclock die.

Locks of the same type are all opened the same way.

Some Modifiers that can diversify the locks are below:
- CRACKED: On the first action, any action taken is correct.
- WEATHERED: Ignore the first time a lock would jam.
- SECURED: The first wrong action causes the lock to jam.
- SPIKED: Wrong actions deals d4 damage to the picker.

## Stealth
Moving silently and unseen is a Save with a bonus equal to your empty slots and a penalty equal to the amount of armor filled slots.

When sneaking as a group one save is made with the penalty and bonuses averaged.
## Degeneration and Leaving the Dungeon
Every time you leave the Dungeon, the biggest treasure pile in the dungeon loses around 20% of its value, stolen away by agents of the Underworld.

The exception to this is if you have a camp setup outside the dungeon you may make a pitstop. Roll the Dungeon die once when exciting and again when re-entering though these rolls may never lower the clock beyond 3.
# Fighting
---
## Rounds
Each Round the Guide describes what it appears like the monsters are going to do. Save against 8, with a bonus for every empty slot, to act first.
## On Your Turn
You take two actions per round: Move to an adjacent zone, Strike, trip, get in front of an ally, fetch an item, or raise a shield.
You may only Strike once. Get creative.
## Attacking
Roll damage based on the weapon you are wielding and deal it to your opponent.
## Defending
You may Gamble your Armor Dice to subtract the result of all your dice from the damage taken. Shields may also be gambled, notably you can resolve a shields gamble before gambling armor.
## Impaired vs Bolstered
Attacks may become Impaired by the fiction. I.e. fighting with a polearm in a narrow tunnel, firing a bow into melee, or attacking while prone. Similarly some attacks may have reasons to be more effective then they regularly are.

When making an attack while impaired your weapon dice are halved. While Bolstered add a d6 to the damage roll.
## Fleeing
If the party agrees to retreat then bar dire circumstances they escape. Each character that escaped gains 2d3 Stress. Any items dropped in the pursuit are lost to the dungeon. Fleeing in this way leaves any fallen or captured ally behind, unless you are holding the fallen and have the slots to do so. The average human is 6 Slots and dragging allows you to ignore their encumbrance.
