# Overview
GURPS only uses six-sided dice, and uses abbreviations for die rolls – for instance, a roll on three dice would be shown as “3d”.
# Task Resolution
The basic mechanic of GURPS is the success roll against a skill or attribute. To succeed, you (or the GM) must roll less than or equal to your skill or attribute level on 3d. The GM may assign modifiers to your skill from -10 (extremely hard) to +10 (extremely easy). A 3 on the dice always succeeds and an 18 always fails!

Sometimes two characters are competing to do something very quickly – for instance, two enemies lunging for a gun. This is called a quick contest. Each competitor attempts a success roll. If one succeeds and the other fails, the winner is obvious. If both succeed, the winner is the one with the largest margin of success. If both fail the winner is the one with the smallest margin of failure. A tie means no one won – it's up to the GM to determine what happened.
# Reaction Rolls
If the PCs encounter a non-player character (NPC) whose relationship to the PCs has not already been determined, the GM may roll 3d6 for a reaction. On a roll 6 or below, the NPC is hostile and works against the PCs. A roll of 7-14 is neutral – he might talk and barter, but won't help. A roll of 15-18 is friendly, and means he actively helps the PCs. A reaction roll may be used as an immediate way to see how an NPC will interact with a character but should also be used after a question is asked or a conversation had.

# Characters
GURPS characters are created by spending Character Points. The GM will assign you a starting budget to build your character.

- Ordinary Folk [25-75]
- Heroes in the Making [75-125]
- Professional Adventurer [125-175]
- Named Heroes [175-250]
- Living Legends [250+]

Characters are defined by their Attributes, Skills, and Traits. All of which cost points. Lowering scores or taking negative traits can even give you more points to spend. However you can never receive more then 60 starting points back from negatives.
## Attributes
Each attribute starts at 10 (Foulkn average) for free. They can be increased using points. A good rule of thumb is that PCs shouldn't have attributes below 8. The four attributes are as follows.

**Strength (ST)**: Sets Hit Points (HP), Basic Lift, and Basic Damage (Dmg). Costs 10 points per level.

**Dexterity (DX)**: Helps determine Basic Speed. Costs 20 points per level.

**Intelligence (IQ)**: Helps you notice things and resist fear. Costs 20 points per level.

**Health (HT)**: Governs how well you resist bad effects, your Fatigue Points (FP) and helps determine Basic Speed. Costs 10 points per level.
## Secondary Characteristics
These are derived from attributes, as follows.

**Hit Points (HP)**: Your body's ability to sustain injury. Your HP starts equal to your ST and costs 2 points to increase. Can generally only be raised by 50% of ST.

**Fatigue Points (FP)**: Your body's “energy supply”. Your FP starts equal to your HT and costs 3 points to increase. Can generally only be raised by 50% of HT.

**Basic Lift (BL)**: The maximum weight you can lift over your head with one hand in one second. It is equal to (STxST)/5 lbs. If BL is 10 lbs or more, round to the nearest whole number. Doubling the time lets you lift 2xBL overhead in one hand. BL is used to calculate encumbrance (p. XX)

**Will (Will)**: your ability to withstand psychological stress and resist supernatural attacks. Equal to IQ and costing 5 points to increase. You cannot raise Will past 20, or lower it by more than 4.

**Perception (Per)**: Your general awareness and accuracy with your senses. Equal to your IQ and costs 5 points to increase.

**Basic Speed**: A measure of your reflexes. Your Basic Speed is your HT and DX added together and divided by 4. Used to determine initiative. Do not round off – a 5.25 is better than a 5. It can be increased by 0.05 for 1 point.

**Basic Move**: A measure of how far you can move in one turn, in hexes (yards). This is equal to your Basic Speed with no fractions; e.g. a Basic Speed of 5.25 gives a Basic Move of 5. It can be increased for 5 points.

**Damage (Dmg)**: Dmg is further broken up into Swing damage (Sw) and Thrust damage (Thr). Both are based on your ST. Consult the chart to the right to determine your damage. Note that this is a damage roll, not a fixed result, and can be further modified by the weapon you wield.

| ST  | Thrust | Swing |    | ST  | Thrust | Swing |
| --- | ------ | ----- | -- | --- | ------ | ----- |
| 9   | 1d-2   | 1d-1  |    | 15  | 1d+1   | 1d+2  |
| 10  | 1d-2   | 1d    |    | 16  | 1d+1   | 2d-1  |
| 11  | 1d-1   | 1d    |    | 17  | 1d+2   | 2d-1  |
| 12  | 1d-1   | 1d+1  |    | 18  | 1d+2   | 2d    |
| 13  | 1d     | 1d+1  |    | 19  | 2d-1   | 2d    |
| 14  | 1d     | 1d+2  |    | 20  | 2d-1   | 2d+1  |

>Example: We want to make a warrior with 100 points. Warriors tend to have high strength but low intelligence. We spend 50 points to raise our ST to 15, since it costs 10 points per level. We lower our IQ to 8, returning 40 points, since it refunds 20 points per level. We keep DX and HT at their default values of 10. We have spent a net total of 10 points and have 90 points left to spend.


## Skills
Skills govern what your character is good at. Skill costs depend on their controlling attribute and their difficulty (Easy, Average, Hard or Very Hard). This is usually written in the form “IQ/E” for, as an example, an Intelligence/Easy skill. 

The chart below shows the cost of skills. To determine the cost, find the skill level you wish to obtain on the chart relative to the skill's controlling attribute, then look across to the difficulty. That is the number of points you must spend to learn that skill at that level.

| Skill Level | Easy | Average | Hard | Very Hard |
| ----------- |:----:|:-------:|:----:|:---------:|
| Attribute-3 |  -   |    -    |  -   |     1     |
| Attribute-2 |  -   |    -    |  1   |     2     |
| Attribute-1 |  -   |    1    |  2   |     4     |
| Attribute+0 |  1   |    2    |  4   |     8     |
| Attribute+1 |  2   |    4    |  8   |    12     |
| Attribute+2 |  4   |    8    |  12  |    16     |
| Attribute+3 |  8   |   12    |  16  |    20     |
| Attribute+4 |  12  |   16    |  20  |    24     |
| Attribute+5 |  16  |   20    |  24  |    28     |
| Extra +1    |  +4  |   +4    |  +4  |    +4     |

>Example: We wish to purchase the Fast-talk skill, which is a IQ/A skill. If our character has a IQ of 13, buying Fast-talk 13 would cost 2 points. Fast-talk 14 would cost 4, etc.

While every character should have at least one weapon skill, you need more than just weapons to survive.

## Traits
Traits are details about your character and how they interact with the game world and system. Certain traits are required to establish the fundamentals of your character while even more can be taken to extrapolate. Below is a checklist of important traits you should take even just to clarify a default.
### Kin
Your Kin is a representation of your ancestry. The most common Kin, Foulkn, costs nothing and grants nothing but you are considered a 20 Point humanoid for the sake of certain spells. While other Kin have various advantages and disadvantages, nothing is set in stone as anyone may differs from the norm.

Whenever possible try to express your character's idiosyncrasies outside of your Kin Template. Even if you must change aspects of your Kin Template you must never shift the overall price of it.

An exception to this is when you wish to play a character with a "mixed" ancestry. In this case you should pick and choose the aspects of the kin involved in a way fitting of your vision of the character. The ending point cost must be equal to the point value of the lowest cost Kin Template, with Foulkn counting as 10 for this purpose.
### Appearance
Appearance is rated in levels. Most people have “Average” appearance, for 0 points. Good looks give a reaction bonus. Unappealing looks give a reaction penalty. These reaction modifiers only affect those who can see you! Those who cannot see you might have to make a new reaction roll upon first meeting you in person (GM’s option).

Reaction modifiers due to appearance only affect humans or beings that finds humans attractive.

**Ugly**: You have any sort of disgusting looks you can come up with. This gives -2 on reaction rolls. -8 points.

**Unattractive**: You look vaguely unappealing, but it’s nothing anyone can put a finger on. This gives -1 on reaction rolls. -4 points.

**Average**: Your appearance gives you no reaction modifiers either way. 0 points.

**Attractive**: You don’t enter beauty contests, but are definitely good looking. This gives +1 on reaction rolls. 4 points.

**Handsome** (or Beautiful): You could enter beauty contests. This gives +4 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your gender, +2 from everyone else. 12 points.

**Very Handsome** (or Very Beautiful): You could win beauty contests – regularly. This gives +6 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your gender, +2 from others. Exception: Members of the same gender with reason to dislike you (more than -4 in reaction penalties, regardless of bonuses) resent your good looks, and react at -2 instead. As well, talent scouts, friendly drunks, slave traders, and other nuisances are liable to become a problem for you. 16 points.
#### Special Option
**Androgynous**: If your appearance is Handsome (Beautiful) or better, you may specify that your looks appeal equally to all sexualities. You get a flat reaction modifier instead of a gender dependent bonus: +3 for Handsome, +4 for Very Handsome.
### Language
Assuming most characters can read and write their “native” language. This ability costs no points, but you should note your native language on your character sheet; e.g., “Common (Native) [0].” Less comprehension is a disadvantage worth negative points.
#### Comprehension Levels
The point cost to learn an additional language depends on your “comprehension level”: a measure of how well you function in that language overall. Writing and speaking comprehension are separate traits. There are four comprehension levels:

**None**: You don’t know the language at all. 0 points.

**Broken**: You know just enough to get by in daily life, but you’re at -3 when using skills that depend on language. 1 point for spoken, 1 point for written.

**Accented**: You can communicate clearly. You’re only at -1 when using skills that depend on language. 2 points for spoken, 2 points for written.

**Native**: You can use the language as well as an educated native. 3 points for spoken, 3 points for written.
#### Literacy
Your written comprehension level determines your degree of literacy in that language:

**Illiteracy**: A written comprehension level of None means that you cannot read the language at all.

**Semi-literacy**: A written comprehension level of Broken means you must read slowly. Roll vs. IQ just to get the basic meaning!

**Literacy**: A written comprehension of Accented or Native means you can read and write at full speed.
### Status
Status is a measure of social standing. In most worlds, Status ranges from -2 (serf or street person) to 8 (powerful emperor), with the average man being Status 0 (freeman or ordinary citizen). If you do not specifically buy Status, you have Status 0. Status costs 5 points per level. 

Status greater than 0 means you are a member of the ruling class in your culture. Your family may be nobles, businessmen or politicians, or some other type of big shots. You may even have achieved Status by your own efforts. As a result others (in your culture only) defer to you, giving you a bonus on all reaction rolls equal to the difference in Status, unless they resent your Status.

High Status carries various privileges such as entrance into fine establishments, access to certain traders, and more. Note that any high-Status person is a likely target for kidnappers and social climbers, and that some folk hate “the ruling class.”
#### Rank
As Status but specific to an organisation such as military or guild. Costing 5 points for each level of rank.
For more on Rank see Guilds and Organisations.
### Wealth
**Very Wealthy**: You start with $20,000 and +2 Status. 30 points.

**Wealthy**: You start with $5,000 and +1 Status. 20 points.

**Comfortable**: You start with $2,000. 10 points.

**Average**: You start with $1,000. 0 points.

**Struggling**: You start with $500. -10 points. 

**Poor**: You start with $200 and -1 Status. -15 points.

**Dead Broke**: You start with nothing and -2 Status. -25 points.
## Advantages
An advantage is a useful trait that gives you a mental, physical, or social “edge” over someone else who otherwise has the same abilities as you. Like all traits, each has a cost in character points. For some advantages, this cost is fixed. Others are bought in levels, usually at a flat cost per level.
## Disadvantages
A disadvantage is a problem or imperfection that renders you less capable than your attributes, advantages, and skills would indicate. That includes anything with a negative character point cost.
## Meta-Traits
Meta-Traits are a collection of Traits that function as one trait. Meaning that any Disadvantages within the Meta-Trait does not count against the negative Character Point limit, unless the Meta-Trait itself is worth negative points. The most popular example of Meta-Traits are Kin.
## Modifiers
Modifiers are extra details about Traits that shift the overall price. Typically represented by a positive or negative percentage. 
> Example: A creature with flight must pay 40 Points. If this flight is granted by wings the price is modified by -25% due to the risks and requirements of winged flight. Meaning a winged creature only needs to pay 30 points for flight.


# Equipment
All characters can use their starting money to outfit themselves. Any magical gear must be run by the GM before being bought as starting gear though really anything bought should be as well.
## Encumbrance
Encumbrance and Move
“Encumbrance” is a measure of the total weight you are carrying, relative to your ST. The effects of encumbrance are divided into five “encumbrance levels.” All but the lowest level will reduce your actual Move to a fraction of your Basic Move and give a penalty to Dodge, as follows:

No Encumbrance (0): Weight up to Basic Lift. Move = Basic Move. Full Dodge.

Light Encumbrance (1): Weight up to 2¥BL. Move = Basic Move ¥ 0.8. Dodge -1.

Medium Encumbrance (2): Weight up to 3¥BL. Move = Basic Move ¥ 0.6. Dodge -2.

Heavy Encumbrance (3): Weight up to 6¥BL. Move = Basic Move ¥ 0.4. Dodge -3.

Extra-Heavy Encumbrance (4): Weight up to 10¥BL. Move = Basic Move ¥ 0.2. Dodge -4.

Drop all fractions. Encumbrance can never reduce Move or Dodge below 1.

Note that these levels are numbered from 0 to 4. When a rule tells you to add or subtract your encumbrance level from a die roll, this is the number to use. For instance, encumbrance gives a penalty to Climbing, Stealth, and Swimming skills.

# Weapon Stats
## Acc (Accuracy)
Add Accuracy to your weapon skill if you took an Aim maneuver on the turn prior to your attack. If you have Heroic Archer (p. 35) and are wielding a bow, you don’t need to Aim – add Acc to skill whenever you Attack or All-Out Attack outside of close combat!
## Bulk
A measure of the weapon’s size and handiness. Bulk penalizes weapon skill during a Move and Attack maneuver or in close combat.
## Parry
A number, such as “+2” or “-1,” indicates the bonus or penalty to your Parry defense when using that weapon; see Parrying (p. XX).

“F” means the weapon is a fencing weapon, which suffers only half the penalty for multiple parries.

“U” means the weapon is unbalanced: you cannot use it to parry after using it to attack on your turn (or vice versa).

“X” means the weapon cannot parry.
## Range
If a weapon has only one range number, this is the Maximum Range (Max) in hexes (yards) at which it can attack a target. If two numbers appear, separated by a slash, the first is Half-Damage Range (1/2D) while the second is Max. Attacks on targets at or beyond 1/2D inflict half damage. Nearly all ranged weapons list 1/2D and Max as multiples of the wielder’s ST – not as fixed numbers. For bows and crossbows, use the weapon’s ST in these formulas (see Bows, Crossbows, and ST, p. 98).
## Reach
The distance in hexes at which a melee weapon can strike; e.g., reach “2” means the weapon can only strike foes two hexes away, not closer or more distant ones. “C” indicates you can use the weapon for Close Combat (p. XX).

Some weapons have more than one reach; e.g. A spear with reach “1, 2” can strike targets either one or two hexes away. An asterisk (\*) next to reach means the weapon requires a Ready maneuver to change reach (e.g., between 1 and 2).
## Shots
The number of shots the weapon gets between reloads. “1” means a missile weapon that can shoot one projectile and then needs reloading.

“T” indicates a thrown weapon. To “reload,” pick it up or ready a new weapon!

The parenthetical number after Shots is the number of one-second Ready maneuvers needed to reload a missile weapon or pull out another thrown weapon.

Blowpipes and Bows: “(2)” means one Ready to draw and position a dart or arrow, and another to prepare the loaded weapon for shooting. A successful Fast-Draw (Arrow) roll turns the first into a free action, making effective reload time (1).

Crossbows and Prodds: “(4)” means two consecutive Ready maneuvers to cock the weapon, one to draw and load a bolt, and one to bring the weapon back into shooting position. This assumes the weapon’s ST is no greater than yours (see Bows, Crossbows, and ST, below). If its ST is one or two greater, cocking takes six Ready maneuvers, so reload time is (8); if its ST is three or four greater, cocking takes 18 turns (and you need a “goat’s foot” device, and must be standing), so reload time is (20); and if its ST is five greater or more, you cannot cock it! A successful Fast-Draw (Arrow) roll shaves off one Ready maneuver.
## ST (Strength)
The minimum Strength needed to use the weapon properly. If you use a weapon that requires more ST than you have, you suffer -1 to weapon skill per point of ST deficit and lose one extra FP at the end of the fight.

For a melee or thrown weapon, your effective ST for damage purposes cannot exceed triple the weapon’s ST statistic. For instance, a large knife has minimum ST 6, so its “maximum ST” is 18; if your ST were 19+, you would compute your damage as if you had ST 18.

“†” means the weapon requires two hands. If you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up), you can use a weapon like this one-handed, but it becomes unready after you attack with it. If you have at least twice the listed ST, you can wield it one-handed with no readiness penalty.

“‡” means the weapon requires two hands and becomes unready after you attack with it, unless you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up). To use it one-handed without it becoming unready, you need at least three times the listed ST.

**Bows, Crossbows, and ST**: Bows and crossbows have their own rated ST, which you must specify when you buy such a weapon. The ST in the table is the lowest possible value. Use the weapon’s rated ST instead of your ST to determine range and damage. You can always use a weapon that’s weaker than you. You can use a stronger crossbow with no penalty, but it will take longer to cock (see Shots).

[1] Can be thrown with a range of ST x1/x1.5 and a bulk of -4. 

[2] Any attack that injures an enemy embeds your weapon. If your victim tries to move away, roll a Quick Contest of ST: If you lose, your weapon is pulled from your grasp! If you win, your enemy can’t move. A tie means the weapon comes free.
At the start of your next turn, you must either relinquish your weapon, leaving it stuck in your foe, or try a ST roll as Ready maneuver. A successful ST roll pulls your weapon free. Failure leaves it embedded. If the weapon comes free for any reason, it inflicts half the injury it did going in. Critical failure on any of your ST rolls means the weapon is till after the battle.

[3] This attack receives damage bonuses per die based on your brawling skill.  +1 if you know it at DX, +2 if you know it at DX+2. Claws don’t affect damage with blows assisted by weapons.

[4] Attempts to parry are at -4; knives and fencing weapons (“F” parry) can’t parry at all! Attempts to block such weapons are at -2.

[5] Gets +2 to disarm when wielded with this skill. To grapple, attack at -4; a successful hit inflicts no damage and you must use a ready maneuver to make a quick ST contest each round to maintain the grapple.

[6] Kicks have a -2 to hit.

[7] Specify maximum reach (1-7 yards) when bought. Cost and weight are per yard. The whip requires ST 3, +1 per yard. Anyone injured on the arm by a whip must roll Against Will modified by the shock penalty for the injury or drop anything in that hand.

You can “crack” a whip at -4 to hit, for +2 damage. Make this a technique.

[3] May entangle or ensnare target; see Special Rules for Thrown Weapons (Exploits, pp. 43-45).

[4] Range is (ST + Skill/5) for a net; round down. Can also be held and used as a melee weapon with reach 1, 2.

# Armor

## Shields
DB: Defense Bonus, tennis number is added to all of your active defense role from attacks to your front or shield side. This bonus is only applicable if the shield is readied. To ready or store a shield takes an amount of ready maneuvers equal to its DB.

| Shield        | DB  | Cost | Weight | Notes  |
| ------------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Small Shield  | 1   | $40  | 8      | [2][3] |
| Medium Shield | 2   | $60  | 15     | [2][3] |
| Large Shield  | 3   | $90  | 25     | [2][4] |

[1] Can be used offensively to Feint or grapple at reach C, 1 (but not for a shield bash or rush). A cloak occupies a hand, and a failed block may endanger your arm.

[2] Can be used offensively, see Shield Bash on the melee weapons table. A spike that gives +1 to damage adds $20 to cost and 5 lbs. to weight before shield modifiers.

[3] Also available as a buckler. You can ready a buckler with one Ready maneuver and drop it as a free action, like a weapon – but it occupies a hand, can be dropped, and doesn’t allow a shield rush. Use Shield (Buckler) skill instead of Shield skill. No effect on statistics.

[4] Large shields get in the way: -2 to all attacks with the other hand (but not with the shield) unless you have Shield-Wall Training. In close combat, apply -3 for DB instead.

# Combat
Combat proceeds in rounds. A round lasts one second. Each round, characters act in the order of their Basic Speed. Each player then chooses a Maneuver for their character from the following list. Most characters can make only one maneuver each round.
## Maneuvers
### Basic Maneuvers
**Move**: Use this maneuver to take Full Movement.

**Attack**: Attack an enemy with a ready weapon. A successful attack requires a success roll against your effective skill with the weapon. If you succeed the target must then fail to Defend (see active Defense below). The exception is if the enemy does not know you are there they do not get to defend, e.g. an attack from behind. As part of your Attack you may Step.

**Aim**: This maneuver can only be used with ranged attacks. Aim at a specific, visible enemy or point. If you attack your target with the same attack on your next turn, you may add your attack's Acc bonus to your effective skill – but if you lose sight of your enemy, make an Active Defense, change targets or change weapons, the bonus is lost. As part of your Aim you may Step.

**Ready**: used for any predominantly physical activity not covered by another maneuver. Use this Maneuver to draw a weapon, pick something up, or load a ranged weapon. Some actions require multiple or even concurrent readies, such as retrieving a potion from you backpack. As part of your Ready you may Step.

**Concentrate**: Focus on a primarily mental task - Spellcasting, non combat skills, or activating an ability that requires this maneuver. If the activity takes successive Concentration you become distracted when: taking damage, making an Active Defense roll, being shoved, or making a resistance roll. You must make a Will roll at -3, failure means you lose your concentration. As part of Concentrate you may Step.

**Free Actions**: Free actions can be performed at any time and do not take up the character’s turn. The most common free actions are to drop something and to talk.
### Advance Maneuvers
**All-Out Attack**: Sacrifice the ability to make any Active Defenses till your next turn to make an attack with full might. Specify one of the three options below when choosing this maneuver with a melee weapon.
 **Determined**: Make one attack with a +4 to hit. 
 **Double**: Make two attacks against the same foe, if you have two ready weapons or one that doesn't have to be readied after use.
 **Strong**: Make one attack. If you hit you get +2 to damage or +1 per die.
If you All-Out Attack with a ranged weapon you instead get +1 to hit.
As part of your All-Out Attack you gain Half Movement.

**All-Out Defense**: Spend all you effort on defending yourself. Specify one of these options when you choose this maneuver.
 **Increased Defense**: Add +2 to one active defense of your choice: Dodge, Parry, or Block. This bonus persists until your next turn.
 **Double Defense**: If you fail a defense roll against an attack, you may try a second, different defense against the same attack; e.g., if you fail a dodge, you may try a block or a parry. If you fail a parry (armed or unarmed) with one hand, a parry using the other hand does qualify as a “different defense.”
As part of your All-Out Defense you gain Half Movement.

**Move and Attack**: Gain full Movement and then attack with a -4 to hit to a maximum effective skill of 9.

**Wait**: Do nothing unless an event you’ve specified in advance occurs before your next turn. Specify the Maneuver and the specific trigger. You gain the movement of the prepared Maneuver which may be taken immediately or once triggered but cannot be split.

#### Attack options
Brace
Deceptive attack
Dual weapon attack
Rapid strike
Stop thrust

## Active Defense
These are defensive maneuvers used on the enemy's turn to prevent him from hitting. After a successful attack the target may attempt any one Active Defense, as long as they are aware of the attack.

**Dodge**: Your dodge skill is equal to your Basic Move + 3. If you make a success roll against this number, you dodge the attack. You may dodge any type of attack and there is no limit to the number of different attacks you can dodge in a turn, but you must be aware of the attacks. Your Dodge skill may be affected by how much you are carrying; see the Equipment section.

**Parry**: To parry, you must have a ready weapon. Your parry skill is equal to half your skill with the weapon you are parrying with +3. Make a success roll against this number and you have parried the attack. You may only parry melee attacks, thrown weapons, or attack and spells that specify they can be parried. Once you’ve attempted a parry with a given weapon or hand, further parries with that weapon or hand have a cumulative -4 per parry after the first.

**Block**: To block, you must have a readied shield or cloak. Your block skill is equal to half your skill with the shield + 3. Make a success roll against this number and you have blocked the attack. You can block any melee or ranged attack, but further blocks suffer a cumulative -5 penalty.

#### Defense options
Retreat
Dodge and drop
Acrobatic dodge
Sacrificial dodge

## Movement
Each maneuver allows for a different amount of movement based on your Basic Move. The three types of Movement are as follows.

**Full Movement**: Move a number of hexes equal to your Basic Move. Alternatively spend half your movement to shift from Prone to Kneeling or from Kneeling to Standing (for more details see Posture, p. XX).

**Half Movement**: Move a number of hexes equal to half of you Basic Move rounded up. Alternatively shift from Prone to Kneeling or from Kneeling to Standing.

**Step**: Move 1 hex. Alternatively you may Stand up from Kneeling.
## Facing
Whenever you have at least a step of movement you may shift your facing freely. You must always face toward one of the six hexes adjacent to your hex. Your facing defines your front, right, left, and back hexes (see illustration). Active defenses suffer a -2 when defending from the side and it is impossible to defend from the back. You may only attack into your front hexes.

![Facing](https://github.com/HeringtonPress/HeringtonPress.github.io/assets/93562930/446fa56c-2cea-482e-b27c-1c9589aa7dd0)

## Posture
**Prone**
While prone you have a movement of 1. You have a -4 to hit with melee attacks. You have a -3 to Active Defense. ranged attacks have a -2 to hit you.

**Kneeling**
While kneeling you have 1/3 movement to a minimum of 1. You have a -2 to hit with melee attacks. You have a -2 to active defense. ranged attacks have a -2 to hit you.

**Standing**
While standing you are unpenalized.
## Extra effort
Various actions can be modified by pushing yourself, physically and mentally, beyond your regular limits. Extra Effort must be declared before resolving any part of an action. E.g. you must declare extra effort melee before rolling to hit.

**Melee attacks**: When you take the Attack maneuver with a melee weapon, you may spend 1 FP to gain the damage from All-Out Attack Strong without giving up defense.

**Ranged attacks**: When you take the Attack maneuver with a ranged weapon, you may spend 1 FP to attack with a +1 to hit.

**Rapid strike**: halve penalty for rapid strike, 1 FP per attack.

**Defense**: When you make an Active Defense, you may spend 1 FP to get a +2.

**Sprinting**: When you have full movement, you may spend 1 FP to move an additional 40% of your Basic Move.

**Step**: When you Step you may spend 1 FP to move an additional hex.
# Advanced Combat Rules
## Banter
Action heroes never shut up in combat – an actor has to earn his pay, after all. But it sometimes serves a purpose. Below, Psychology works like an Influence skill, because in the movies, skilled police psychologists and negotiators are good at this stuff!

**Drawing Aggression**: You can use Fast-Talk or Psychology to unleash taunts and jibes calculated to draw an opponent’s aggression. Take a Concentrate maneuver and roll a Quick Contest of skill against the higher of the enemy’s IQ or Will. If you win, that foe comes after you, changing targets if necessary. A tie does nothing. If you lose, he targets a hurt or otherwise vulnerable team member just to spite you! Win, lose, or tie, if you roll a critical success, your mark also makes an All-Out Attack on his next turn.

**Uttering Threats**: You can try Intimidation or Psychology to discourage an enemy, provided that he’s neither Indomitable nor Unfazeable. This works at -5 once combat has begun – but a gun gives you a bonus equal to the absolute value of its Bulk (e.g., +4 for a .50AE hand-cannon), and you get +1 if you light up your rival with a targeting laser. Then roll as for drawing aggression. Victory by 5 or more means he flees the fight. If you win by 1-4, your opponent hesitates, taking that many All-Out Defense maneuvers, but doesn’t leave. If you tie or lose, he comes after you! This trick only works while the team allows enemies to run away unscathed. Shooting one in the back dooms this option to failure for the rest of the encounter.
## Close quarters
When making an attack at a target closer then your reach, you have a penalty to hit equal to your maximum reach × 4. When parrying the penalty is max reach × 2. For weapons that require you to shift your reach use the current max reach for these calculations.
## Under water
- Default swimming speed is move/5 rounded down. Step grants no movement unless your swim speed is above 4.
- Weapon skills are capped by the Swimming skill, unless you have the Swim spell on or are Aquatic or Amphibious.
- Sw damage suffers a penalty of -2 x max reach. Thr damage suffers -1 x max reach.
- Ranged attacks into and out of the water are at -4, 1/10 range, -1 per die of damage, some attacks can't penetrate.
- No Parry except unarmed or close combat weapons, no Block (but you get DB), Dodge is normal for your move.
## Grappling
If you have an empty hand, you can grab foes or their equipment. You must be in your opponent’s hex to try this.

Each attempt requires an Attack, All-Out Attack, or Move and Attack maneuver, and is considered an attack. If your opponent is lying down or kneeling, you must kneel or lie down unless your rival’s Size Modifier is two or more greater than yours; however, you may do this as the step of an Attack maneuver.

Roll against DX or a grappling skill – Brawling – to hit.

*Modifiers*: Instead of standard modifiers for hit locations and weapons, apply 0 to hit the torso; ‑1 for an arm or leg; ‑3 for the head; or ‑4 for something someone is holding (like a weapon). add your SM difference as a bonus, in favour of larger grapplers. If using more then 2 hands, +2 per hand beyond the first 2. Your opponent defends normally. The effects of a hit depend on what you grabbed.

- If you grabbed an item, you’re now grasping it; if it’s a weapon, your rival cannot use it to attack or defend. On subsequent turns, you may try to wrestle it away. Each attempt counts as an attack and requires a Regular Contest of ST. If you win, you take the item away. If you lose, you lose your grip and must start over.

- If you grabbed your foe, your victim is now at ‑4 to DX – which gives ‑2 to blocks and parries, and ‑1 to dodges – while you’re holding on. Until your opponent breaks free or you let go, your victim cannot move away. (Exception: You cannot prevent a rival with more than twice your ST from leaving . . . you’re just extra encumbrance!) You may try *Actions After a Grapple* on subsequent turns.

If you grappled a body part other than the torso, all of the above applies and that one body part cannot be used to attack or defend. There are also additional effects:

- **Arm**: You cannot snatch a weapon away, but you can force your victim to drop it. Roll a Regular Contest of ST exactly as if you had grabbed the weapon.

- **Leg**: You get +3 if you try a takedown (below).

- **Head**: You may attempt to strangle (below).

Grappling someone doesn’t mean that person is grappling you! If your foe wants to do that, he must grapple on his turn. Grappling someone doesn’t give you defense penalties, either. However, you can’t parry with a limb without releasing its hold on your victim.

### Actions After a Grapple
Grappling a foe lets you try special moves on later turns, provided your victim hasn’t broken free. Each requires an Attack or All-Out Attack maneuver, and counts as an attack.

**Takedown**: Bear a standing opponent to the ground. Roll a Quick Contest, with each contestant using the highest of ST, DX, or best grappling skill. If you aren’t standing, you have the usual attack penalty for posture. If you’re grappling your enemy’s leg you get +3. If you win, your victim falls down in your hex, losing his grip if he was grappling you. If you lose, you suffer those effects! On a tie, nothing happens.

**Pin**: Prevent an opponent who’s lying down from acting. You must be grappling your foe’s torso. Roll a Regular Contest of ST. The larger fighter gets +3 per point of Size Modifier difference. The fighter with the most free hands has +3. If you win, your foe is now helpless; you must stay there to hold him down, but you can free one hand for other actions. If you lose or tie, nothing happens.

A hand not committed to grappling can be used for an Attack, All-Out Attack, or Ready maneuver. You can bite even if your hands are busy. To Aim, Feint, Concentrate, Wait, or make a ranged attack you must first pin your foe.

You may also perform these free actions on your turn:
- Release your grip with one or more hands.
- Drag or carry your victim. Only after pinning your foe, unless you have more than twice your opponent’s ST. Just move or step normally, dragging or carrying your enemy (who counts as encumbrance, likely reducing your Move).

### Actions After Being Grappled
If you’re grappled, you can’t take a Move maneuver unless your ST is more than twice your foe’s. Aim, Concentrate, Wait, and ranged attacks are impossible. If you’re pinned, you can’t take any maneuver that requires physical movement except to Break Free.

**Break Free**: Attempt to end your enemy’s grapple or pin. This counts as an Attack maneuver. You may try every turn if grappled, every 10 turns if pinned. Roll a Quick Contest of ST. Your opponent gets +5 if grappling you with two hands or pinning you with one, +10 if pinning you with two. If either of you has three or more arms, each arm beyond the first two gives +2. If you win, you’re free and may step immediately. If your rival falls unconscious or dies, you’re automatically free at once; a stunned foe doesn’t let go but has ‑4 in the Contest.

If you prefer, you have other options:

**Attack or All-Out Attack**: You can try if not pinned! You cannot use any limb or weapon that has been grappled. The ‑4 for being grappled, and any posture penalty, still apply.

**Ready**: You can Ready an item if you have a hand free and aren’t pinned, but you must roll vs. DX. Failure means you drop the item. A Ready to switch an ability off or on always works.
# Damage, Health, and Recovery
**Damage**: Damage is almost always ST-based and expressed as a modifier to the wielder’s basic thrusting (thr) or swinging (sw) damage, from the Damage Table (Character Creation). For example, a spear does “thr+2,” so with ST 11 and therefore a basic thrusting damage of 1d-1, you’ll inflict 1d+1 damage with a spear.

A parenthetical number after damage – e.g., (2) – is an armor divisor. Divide the target’s DR by this number before subtracting it from your damage. For instance, an attack with a divisor of (2) would halve DR.

Each damage rating is followed by an abbreviation indicating damage type:

| Abbreviation |      Type      | Wounding Multiplier |
|:------------:|:--------------:| ------------------- |
|      cr      |    crushing    | x1                  |
|     cut      |    cutting     | x1.5                |
|     imp      |    impaling    | x2                  |
|     pi-      | small piercing | x0.5                |
|      pi      |    piercing    | x1                  |
|     spec     |   see notes    |                     |

Any damage that penetrates DR is multiplied by the damage type's Wounding Multiplier. A victim loses HP equal to this new sum.

A successful attack always does at least 1 point of damage (before DR).

**Armor**: In GURPS, armor (and some spells) grant a damage resistance (DR) value. Any successful attack will have its damage reduced by the character's DR. If an attack does the character's DR or less in damage, then the character takes no damage at all.

**Hit Points**: You do not automatically die at 0 HP, but every turn thereafter you must make a success roll against HT, with a -1 for each multiple of negative HP. Failure means you instantly pass out.

If you reach the end of an encounter and are still below 0 HP make an HT roll -5. On a success no further rolls are needed till you receive damage again, on a failure you pass out.

If you reach a negative multiple of your HP, you must immediately make an HT roll. On a failure you die. If you fail by 2 or less you are "Mortally wounded".

While Mortally Wounded you must make an HT roll every half hour or die. If you critically succeed on this roll you recover miraculously. If someone is tending to you, you can make a roll against their First Aid skill instead but this requires that they be with you the full half hour. It takes an hour and a roll against Medicine -3 to stabilize someone who is Mortally Wounded. Magical healing does not work while you are Mortally Wounded, though certain spells can heal the Wound.

If you reach -5xHP you die instantly, -6xHP your body is destroyed.

**Recovery**: A character with the First Aid skill can make a success roll to attempt to heal a wounded character (don't forget equipment modifiers.) This requires one minute and restores 1 HP if successful. If the caregiver continues to care for the wounded character for another 30 minutes, the wounded character recovers 1d-2 HP – minimum 1 *instead*.

Further healing requires rest. At the end of each day of rest, make a success roll against HT. On success, the character regains 1 HP for every 10 points of max HP (minimum 1).

Characters that fell unconscious automatically wake up 15 minutes after their HP becomes positive. Or an hour after recieving First Aid.

Fatigue points can be recovered at a rate of 1 per ten minutes of rest.

# Magic and Miracles
## Casting Spells
Unless otherwise stated, all spells cost at least 1 FP and require no particular ritual, just quiet concentration. With the exception of Obvious spells, there is no simple way to tell that a spell has been cast except to notice its effect; e.g., if a sorcerer casts Shape Fire (p. 16), anyone can see the fire moving, but cannot automatically tell that the sorcerer is behind it.

Many spells require no roll at all to cast, though they may require a secondary skill roll to gauge effectiveness, such as using Innate Attack to aim. Add Sorcery Talent to either type of roll; for ranged spells, also subtract range penalties (p. B550) unless otherwise specified.

The subject must be perceptible, typically through sight or touch.
## Spells
Every caster has a collection of Known spells, the magical tricks that they can rely upon in any situation. Each one is an advantage (or set of advantages) plus modifiers – what GURPS Powers calls an “ability.” See Tome of Spells for many examples.

Each of these spells is bought as an alternative ability to the Source (Sorcery, Wizardry, or Clerical). Put simply, this means:

• The full cost of the spell cannot exceed the cost of the caster’s Empowerment. For example, because No-Smell has a full cost of 63 points, only sorcerers who’ve spent 63+ points on Sorcerous Empowerment can learn it.

• The caster pays only 1/5 of the full cost shown for that spell, rounded up. For example, although No-Smell has a full cost of 63 points, the sorcerer actually pays just 63/5 = 13 points to learn it.

• The caster can use only one spell from a source at a time. This means that they cannot cast one spell while maintaining a different one from the same empowerment. To be able to focus on two spells at once, the caster must pay full cost for their most expensive known spell. For three spells at once, they have to pay full price for their two most expensive spells, and so on.
### Maintaining Spells
Any spell with a duration of “Indefinite” can be maintained for as long as the sorcerer wishes. This costs 1 FP per minute, but does not require concentration (or any other special actions) unless specified. However, while maintaining a spell a caster cannot cast further spells.

Spells with a fixed or permanent duration are “fire and forget” and thus do not require maintenance. Once cast, they last for the duration and do not hinder the sorcerer’s spellcasting ability. In fact, he couldn’t terminate them early even if he wanted to! It is because of this that Cancel Spells is one of the first few spells that most sorcerers learn.

Perk-level spells that are taken as learned spells can be maintained indefinitely for free without needing to cancel other active Spells.

### Identifying Spells
Obvious spells and spells that require components(see wizardry) make it clear to anyone with any awareness of how magic works that a spell is being cast. Someone may roll vs. an applicable skill (Thaumatology/Occultism or IQ) as a free action to estimate what the spell will do. This roll is at -4 if the spell is only verbal/somatic/material/obvious, or at no penalty if more then one of the 4.

## Casting
To build a character with access to Spells but without the ability to "Improvise" simply buy spells as alternate abilities to each other. It is still important to establish the Source of these abilities as you and the GM will work to establish the Limitations of the spell selection as you would with Sorcerous Empowerment. When buying a Talent for your source price it with the guidance of Sorcerous Talent.

---
## Mana
Mana is the ambient energy that underlies wizardly spells. Its levels and effects are as follows:

**Very High Mana**: Rare and unstable places where mana is pushing into the world. A wizard who casts a wizardly spell recovers any personal FP used (not other energy) a second later. However, all failures are treated as critical failures – and actual critical failures produce spectacular disasters of the GM’s choosing!

**High Mana**: Not uncommon and seemingly random sites where magical power pools. Spells have a +4 to skills for all purposes. Magic items are similarly affected. More over, activating magic items costs 1 less FP.

**Normal Mana**: The usual assumption when the GM hasn’t specifically adjusted the mana level. Magic works normally.

**Low Mana**: Places where magic is weak – which, like high-mana areas, seem to be random and not especially rare. Spells have -5 to skill for all purposes. Magic items are similarly affected.

**No Mana**: Extremely uncommon locales where mana is utterly absent. Wizardly magic won’t work, and ongoing spells are instantly dispelled. Exception: The effects of permanent spells and magic items are merely suspended, and resume once taken to an area with mana.

Mana is normal on average, but low- and high-mana spots are far more common than low- or high-sanctity ones. In some places, mana level fluctuates over time! Very high and no mana are plot devices best used sparingly by the GM.

## Sorcery

### Sorcerous Empowerment
#### 20 points for level 1, + 10/level
Sorcerers have an innate connection to magic, typically by blood. This allows them to learn and cast spells but additionally they may improvise spells in a way unique to them.

improvised magic is a last resort; these “on the fly” spells are significantly weaker than anything in their normal repertoire.

A sorcerer may improvise any spell with a full cost no greater than their Sorcerous Empowerment level. In effect, the sorcerer is spending each level of Sorcerous Empowerment as though it were a single character point to temporarily “buy” a spell.

Example: With Sorcerous Empowerment 1 [20], you can improvise any spell with a full cost of 1 point – no more. You could improvise the basic version of Ignite Fire but not the improved version. If you had Sorcerous Empowerment 19 (Limited Colleges, Fire, -40%) [120], you could improvise any Fire spell from Ignite Fire up through Shape Fire 1.

Otherwise, casting an improvised spell works just like casting a normal one: two Concentrate maneuvers, or just one if it was the last spell you cast. In other words, improvising a spell is no more difficult than switching between two known spells.

**Hardcore Improvisation**
A sorcerer who needs to exceed the bounds of their normal improvisational ability may attempt to push their limits, improvising a spell based on the cost of their Sorcerous Empowerment rather than its level.

This requires no additional time; it still takes just two Concentrate maneuvers to improvise a new spell. After the first Concentrate maneuver, pay 3 FP and roll against Will + Talent.

*Modifiers: -4 if the full cost of the spell is no more than 25% of the cost of your Sorcerous Empowerment; -6 if no more than 50%; -8 if no more than 75%; and -10 if higher (up to 100%). +1 for every additional FP you spend above and beyond the 3 FP required – but this can only offset the penalty for spell cost, not provide a net bonus.*

If this roll succeeds, you improvise the new spell for a single casting. On a critical success, you also recover all FP spent on the improvisation attempt and get +1 on any rolls to cast or use the spell. You must still cast the new spell – pay 1 FP, make any casting roll necessary, and so on. If your improvisation roll succeeds but your casting roll fails, you have to start over from scratch. If the spell has an indefinite duration, you may maintain it normally. After casting the spell, you are considered to have no spell currently readied.

If your improvisation roll fails, the FP and second of concentration are wasted, but you can try again next turn at no penalty. On a critical failure, however, your sorcery shuts down for the next 1d minutes.

>Example: Ada needs to cast Light 1 [11] now – but she doesn’t know it and has only Sorcerous Empowerment 1 [20]. She must therefore use hardcore improvisation. Ada has Will 13 and Sorcery Talent 4, and Light’s 11-point cost is over 50% but under 75% of the cost of her Sorcerous Empowerment. She takes a Concentrate maneuver, decides to spend a total of 8 FP, rolls against 13 (Will) + 4 (Talent) - 8 (up to 75%) + 5 (extra FP) = 14, and succeeds! On her next turn, she takes the second Concentrate maneuver to actually cast the spell, and succeeds. After all this, if she wants to cast Light again, she’ll have to start from scratch; it is not considered “the last spell she cast” as a normally improvised or known spell would be.

#### Special Limitations
The following modifiers are variants of each other; take one or the other, never both.

*Limited Colleges*: For convenience, Sorcery separates its spells into the same colleges as GURPS Magic. If you can cast spells from only one of these colleges, this is a -40% limitation. Two colleges are -30%; three, -20%; and four (the maximum), -10%. This affects the spells you can learn and what you can improvise.

*Limited Scope*: At the GM’s option, you may be able to limit your Wizardly Study in a way that doesn’t line up perfectly with the spell colleges. If so, use the values above to find a reasonable limitation value. For example, “Limited Scope, Mind-altering spells” would be equivalent to two colleges (Communication and Empathy plus Mind Control) along with a modest collection of spells from the other colleges, and would thus be comparable to three colleges (-20%).

### Sorcerous Talent
#### 10/level or 5/level
This advantage is the power Talent for sorcery. It costs 10 points per level – or only 5 points/level if the caster’s Sorcerous Empowerment has any degree of Limited Colleges or Limited Scope. 

Sorcery Talent adds to every roll made to cast a sorcerous spell or to use that spell well. For example, it adds to Innate Attack skill to hit with a Missile spell, to Engineer skill to brace a tunnel with magic, and so on. It even adds to Occultism or Thaumatology when rolling to answer questions about sorcery. Add the higher of Sorcerous Empowerment or Sorcery Talent to Will when your spells must resist countermagic.

The GM must determine the maximum level of Sorcery Talent in the campaign. For most games, four levels is a reasonable limit. In a cinematic or over-the-top setting, the GM may wish to raise this to six levels, 10 levels, or no limits at all!

---

## Wizardry

Every spell cast through Wizardry requires a roll from a relevant School of Magic skill. The Schools of magic are IQ/VH skills that default to Thaumatology -6. If a Spell falls under multiple Schools a Wizard may use the Skill of their choosing.

Each spell in Wizardry requires at least 1 of the following modifiers; Verbal -10%, Somatic -10%, or Material -10%. Verbal requires the wizard to chant and thus is impossible if they are gagged or without air. Somatic requires the wizard to be able to move their hands freely. They must have at least one hand free and cannot have any of their arms bound. Material requires the wizard to use components of arcane quality to cast (p X). A wizard can buy off these modifiers, representing a further familiarity with the spell, but must always leave at least 1.

### Wizardly Study
#### 14.4 points for level 1, + 5.4/level 
By reading spellbooks, scrolls, or other spellcasting manuals, you can temporarily learn magic spells.

Wizardly Study can be taken multiple times, creating individual “Slots” of Wizardly Study. Each Wizardly Study slot can hold one spell at a time. 

If you have Known spells, spells bought as alternative abilities to Wizardly Study, then you can prepare them into a slot as a Ready maneuver without study. To fill the slot with a non Known spell, you must study a suitable work for seconds equal to the full cost of the spell.

A studied spell can only be prepared into a slot whose level is equal to or greater than the full cost of the spell. A successful Speed-Reading roll halves study time, on a failure you waste that time struggling to grasp it. To be able to cast it properly, you will have to study the work again in full.

A Spell who’s full cost is equal to or less than the amount of character points in a Wizardly Study slot can be ritually casted. Study the spell as if you were preparing it but you must cast it immediately. When you cast a spell in this way it leaves the slot used empty.

>Example: Calryn needs to cast Borrow Language [13] to communicate with a stranger he met on his travels. Since he has it recorded in his spell book but only has Wizardly Study 4 he'll have to ritually cast it. First he frees up the slot by un-preparing whatever spell was in it as a free action. Then studies Borrow Language in his spell book for 13 seconds. On the 14th second he immediately begins casting it. After casting it, successfully or not, the slot is now empty as if you had just unprepared it.

#### Special Limitations
The following modifiers are variants of each other; take one or the other, never both.

*Limited Colleges*: For convenience, Sorcery separates its spells into the same colleges as GURPS Magic. If you can cast spells from only one of these colleges, this is a -40% limitation. Two colleges are -30%; three, -20%; and four (the maximum), -10%. This affects the spells you can learn and what you can improvise.

*Limited Scope*: At the GM’s option, you may be able to limit your Wizardly Study in a way that doesn’t line up perfectly with the spell colleges. If so, use the values above to find a reasonable limitation value. For example, “Limited Scope, Mind-altering spells” would be equivalent to two colleges (Communication and Empathy plus Mind Control) along with a modest collection of spells from the other colleges, and would thus be comparable to three colleges (-20%).

### Wizardly Talent
#### 10/level
This advantage is the power Talent for Wizardry. It costs 10 points per level.

Wizardly Talent adds to every roll made to cast a Wizardly spell or to use that spell well. For example, it adds to Innate Attack skill to hit with a Missile spell, to Engineer skill to brace a tunnel with magic, and so on. It even adds to Occultism or Thaumatology when rolling to answer questions about Wizardry. Add the higher of Wizardly Study or Wizardly Talent to Will when your spells must resist countermagic.

The GM must determine the maximum level of Wizardly Talent in the campaign. For most games, four levels is a reasonable limit. In a cinematic or over-the-top setting, the GM may wish to raise this to six levels, ten levels, or no limits at all!

---

## Clerical

### Clerical Empowerment
#### 15 points for level 1 + 6/level
This is the base ability for clerical spellcasters. Clerical Empowerment is used to request abilities or miracles that are not covered by learned prayers. Learned prayers are taken as Alternative Abilities to Clerical Empowerment.

By default, this advantage represents having a connection with a patron deity with a very broad portfolio. In settings with multiple deities with various portfolios a scope limitation must be applied, using the guidelines from _Limited Scope_ (Above).

A character with Divine Empowerment can request any ability (be it a divine spell, a passive ability, or a skill) covered by the patron deity's portfolio at any time. This ability's cost must be equal or lower than Divine Empowerment's level.

The request requires the character to hold the deity's holy symbol in their hand and pray for a second per character point, taking consecutive Concentrate maneuvers. After the prayer, make a roll against the activation number of 11, modified as per *Petition Roll Modifiers* (See Below).

Failure means that the character gets no response, but can try again. Each successive attempt costs one FP. If the repeated attempt succeeds, later attempts at requesting that ability no longer cost FP. If the character is reduced to three or fewer FP, they must rest until _all_ FP is regained before they can attempt to use Clerical Empowerment _and_ all learned prayers again. Success means that the deity answers the call for help and grants the ability in question. This ability lasts for one hour, or until the character decides to request a new one or switch to a learned prayer. In any case, five minutes must pass between the deactivation of the granted ability and the next request.

**Hardcore Improvisation**
A Cleric who needs to exceed the bounds of their normal petitioning ability may attempt to push their limits, requesting an ability based on the cost of their Empowerment rather than its level.

This requires no additional time, but costs 3 FP and still requires a Petition Roll.

*Modifiers: -4 if the full cost of the ability is no more than 25% of the cost of your Empowerment; -6 if no more than 50%; -8 if no more than 75%; and -10 if higher (up to 100%). +1 for every additional FP you spend above and beyond the required – but this can only offset the penalty for cost, not provide a bonus.*

If this roll succeeds, you improvise the new ability for a single use. On a critical success, you also recover all FP spent on the improvisation attempt and get +1 on any rolls to use the ability. If the ability is a spell with an indefinite duration, you may maintain it normally. After using the ability, you are considered to have no ability currently granted.

If your improvisation roll fails, the FP and seconds of prayer are wasted, but you can try again next turn at no penalty. On a critical failure, however, your sorcery shuts down for the next 1d minutes.
#### Petition Roll Modifiers
- +1 for a five-minute prayer or +2 for a two-hour prayer.
- +1 if you pray loudly, brandish your holy book or symbol, and succeed at a Religious Ritual roll.
- +1 if at least 25 devout worshipers join you (willingly and wholeheartedly) in your prayer; +2 for 100 worshipers; +3 for 1,000; or +4 for +10,000!
- -5 in a place of low sanctity (to your god), +1 in a place of high sanctity or similar “holy area,” or +2 in a place of very high sanctity or “high holy area.” In an area with no sanctity, you cannot succeed!
- -1 for every successful prayer your deity has granted you in the last 24 hours. Learned prayers and failed prayers do not cause a penalty here.

### Clerical Talent
#### 5/level
Clerical Talent adds to every roll made to cast a miracle or to use that miracle well. For example, it adds to Innate Attack skill to hit with a Missile and so on. It even adds to religion or Thaumatology when rolling to answer questions about miracles. Add the higher of Clerical Empowerment or Clerical Talent to Will when your miracle must resist counter-miracles.

The GM must determine the maximum level of Talent in the campaign. For most games, four levels is a reasonable limit. In a cinematic or over-the-top setting, the GM may wish to raise this to six levels, ten levels, or no limits at all!

# Imbuement

## Imbue
#### 10, 20, or 40 points
You can learn Imbuement Skills that grant additional capabilities to weapons ready in your hands – including your hands themselves, claws, and so on. Each level of Imbue (maximum three) gives access to more and increasingly powerful Imbuement Skills. The prerequisite level of Imbue for each skill is noted with that skill.

#### Special Limitations
Unmodified Imbue is a “wild” ability that works anywhere and isn’t subject to special countermeasures, although protection effective against the type of attack that the empowered weapon delivers works normally. However, Imbue is often associated with a particular power source and subject to that source’s drawbacks; this may even be a requirement in certain game worlds. Simulate this by giving Imbue a suitable power modifier; e.g., Chi (-10%), Divine (-10%), Magical (-10%), or Psionic (-10%). An upside of adding any power modifier is that the power’s Talent adds to Imbuement Skill rolls! E.g. Wizardly Talent adds to Imbuement skill rolls with the Magical modifier.

One special limitation is common on both wild and power linked Imbue:

*Limited Skill Access*: Your Imbue only enables you to acquire some Imbuement Skills (each of which you can still buy for multiple weapon skills). The limitation is -80% for a single skill, -60% for two, -40% for three, or -20% for four skills. Access to five or more Imbuement Skills isn’t a meaningful limitation. The GM may require PCs who want two to four skills to select thematically related choices – e.g., Burning Strike and Incendiary Weapon – rather than cherry-pick favorites.

### Multiple Imbue Advantages
You can buy more than one copy of Imbue provided they all have power modifiers that differ. You can give any or all of them Limited Skill Access, if you wish; this is occasionally a little cheaper than Imbue for one source with the same total number of skills, but not very often – and not by much. When you have multiple instances of Imbue like this, you must learn each Imbuement Skill for a specific source; e.g., Envenomed Weapon (Bow; Magical) isn’t the same as Envenomed Weapon (Bow; Chi).

This has one significant drawback, of course: You have to pay extra points for two or more versions of Imbue – and possibly for several versions of your favorite Imbuement Skills to go with them. This is more than offset by two major benefits, however.

The most potent benefit is that you can use differently sourced versions of the same Imbuement Skill simultaneously, like any two other compatible skills, provided that you can make the skill rolls and afford the FP cost; see Multiple Skills (below).

## Imbuement Skills

Imbuement Skills have no default, except across specialties (see Specialties, below). All are DX/VH, although the GM is welcome to make them IQ/VH if that would better suit the power source of Imbue (e.g., for psionics). Every Imbuement Skill has some level of Imbue as a prerequisite.

### Specialties
All Imbuement Skills require specialization by particular combat skill. For instance, Multi-Shot (Pistol) – associated with Guns (Pistol) – is different from Multi-Shot (Bow). You can specialize in any weapon skill that suits the skill type (see Types of Imbuement Skills below), and there are two further specialties that work slightly differently:

Throwing: This specialty lets you imbue hurled objects and Thrown Weapons.

Unarmed: This specialty enables you to charge up barehanded attacks regardless of what unarmed combat skill you use – although you’ll find striking skills more useful. It covers kicks, punches, and blows with Claws, Strikers, Teeth, etc. It doesn’t include natural ranged attacks such as a dragon’s flame breath as you can’t imbue a ranged attack bought with points, whether natural (like a racial ability) or not, even if it has gadget limitations. To this end, the Innate Attack skills are never a valid specialty for Imbuement Skills.

You might be able to enhance spells and/or equipment other than weapons. These special cases have important rules of their own. For details, see Imbuing Spells (p. X) and Noncombat Imbuement (p. X).

Specialties of a given Imbuement Skill default to each other at the same penalty as the associated combat skills. For instance, if you know Flaming Strike (Sword), you can attempt Flaming Strike (Knife) at -3.

To be able to imbue more than one weapon type, buy several specialties – possibly improving them from default, for related weapons.

#### Types of Imbuement Skills
Imbuement Skills are divided into three basic classes based on what weapons they can affect:

**General**: Any specialty is possible – Throwing, Unarmed, or any weapon skill.

**Melee**: Allowed specialties are those for melee combat skills (all Melee Weapon skills, Net, and
Shield) and Unarmed.

**Ranged**: Only missile and thrown weapon specialties are available. For missile weapons, it’s the ammunition that’s imbued.

This distinction is made on the grounds of whether the granted effects make sense for a given category of weapons. For instance, enhancements that affect ranged combat stats have no meaningful definition for melee weapons.
Imbuement Skills are also split into two large functional categories; see Enhancement Skills (p. X) and Transformation Skills (p. X). 

#### Using Imbuement Skills
To use an Imbuement Skill, you must be holding a ready weapon of a type that skill can affect; a missile weapon must also be loaded and ready to shoot. You cannot empower an unready weapon or unloaded missile weapon, or a weapon that you, personally, aren’t using. You can never imbue a weapon and hand it off to someone else – Weapon Buff Spells are what you are looking for!

Imbuement Skills require no concentration or preparation. Roll before you make each attack roll. If you succeed, add the skill’s effects to that attack and mark off 1 FP. Failure simply means you don’t get the benefit of the skill but keep your FP. Critical failure costs 2 FP.

Each use of an Imbuement Skill costs 1 FP. You can pay this with standard FP or, if your Imbue advantage is part of a power, out of an Energy Reserve (Powers pg 119) associated with that power. You can try to avoid this cost by making your Imbuement Skill roll at -5 (but if you critically fail, you still pay 2 FP).

Many Imbuement Skills offer variable effects. This doesn’t change FP cost but gives an additional penalty, cumulative with the -5 to avoid FP cost. Without very high skill, it often isn’t possible to attempt the more potent effects “for free” (or at all!).

You can use an Imbuement Skill multiple times per turn: roll and pay FP once per use. A rapid-fire attack is just one attack roll, so roll and pay FP only once for that. Keeping the special effects of your skills “on” full-time while your weapon is in hand requires no skill roll or FP – thus, even a low level of skill can look cool!

#### Defensive Use
You can attempt to imbue a weapon on somebody else’s turn for such purposes as parrying and discouraging a foe from grabbing your weapon. To do so, roll (Imbuement Skill/2) + 3, adding +1 for Combat Reflexes. The modifiers and FP cost work as usual. Success gives your weapon the skill’s usual benefits for the duration of one defensive action.

#### Multiple Skills
You can use as many different Imbuement Skills as you like, provided that you can make the skill rolls and afford the FP cost. You can even use the same skill more than once if you know it for several power sources. However, you can never use more than one Transformation Skill of any kind per attack, certain skills are mutually exclusive, and you can’t combine skills that produce exactly the opposite effect (if there’s any doubt, the GM’s decision is final).

### Enhancement Skills
Essentially, Enhancement Skills do for weapons what various modifiers from the Basic Set and Powers do for advantages. In most cases, you can combine these skills with each other and with Transformation Skills – although some are relatively useless if you transform the weapon into a non-damaging one, and a few are mutually exclusive.

**Annihilating Weapon**
 Melee; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Your damaging melee weapon automatically gets to roll its usual damage against any weapon that parries it – in effect, it’s destructive for parrying purposes, just like a force sword. Roll its damage normally and apply it to the parrying weapon (or body part, if your opponent made an unarmed parry).
 This effect is always obvious – your weapon flames, vibrates, turns to brilliant green energy, or otherwise telegraphs its destructive nature. Thus, canny foes can avoid the worst of it by relying on Dodge instead. However, you can trigger your skill defensively (see Defensive Use, p. 5) so that your weapon damages a rival’s weapon or body when you parry him.

**Arching Shot**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 This lets a ranged weapon arch up over the target and strike from the top, regardless of its normal ballistics. Effects are identical to Overhead (p. B107): the attack bypasses any cover that doesn’t offer overhead protection, negates penalties to hit for low target postures, and gives the victim -2 to defend the first time he’s attacked (after that, he’ll be on the lookout!). Arching Shot is useful for getting arrows and bullets to targets that are behind a barrier of finite height that blocks projectiles but not vision (e.g., a Force Wall spell).

**Bank Shot**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 You can bounce your damaging ranged attack off “hard cover” in the environment in order to reach your target. The exact DR and HP of the things you’re bouncing the shot off aren’t important. What matters is that these objects are convincingly hard: walls and rocks, not curtains and ferns.
 To use this skill, plot your course and count the bounces. If there’s nothing but floor or ground around, then only one bounce is possible: from you, to the floor, and back up to your target. Once you have your course, roll vs. Bank Shot.

 Modifiers: -2 per bounce after the first (-2 for two bounces, -4 for three, and so on); an extra -2 for each ricochet off something fragile, like rice paper or window glass.

 If this works, make a standard ranged-attack roll to hit with the imbued projectile. Use the full range along the zigzag path to the target. An alerted target always gets a defense, but this is at -1 per bounce.

**Conic Blast**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 This skill is only available for missile weapons (bows, guns, etc.). It converts a single ranged attack into a cone that originates from the weapon, similar to a blast of grapeshot; see Area and Spreading Attacks (p. B413). An unmodified skill roll gives a cone that’s RoF yards wide at the attack’s Max range. High-RoF weapons get broader cones – not multiple cones.

 Modifiers: You can spread the attack further at -1 per extra yard of maximum width.

**Continuing Attack**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 This skill causes wounds from a damaging weapon to worsen after the initial attack. Choose an effect consistent with the attack you’re enhancing – acid or big grubs eating away at the victim, bleeding, rotting, sticky napalm, venom, etc. Whatever the visuals, the effect is to give the attack a form of Cyclic (pp. B103-104).
 An unmodified roll means that if the initial attack injured the target at all, he will suffer the same injury again in one day’s time.

 Modifiers: For a shorter interval, roll at -2 for 1 hour, -4 for 1 minute, -6 for 10 seconds, or -8 for 1 second. Repeated cycles are possible: for standard 1 day intervals, roll at -1 per cycle after the first; for other intervals, multiply the time penalty by the total number of intervals (e.g., -24 for three cycles 1 second apart).

 This is injury that comes right off HP – not damage that must penetrate DR again, be multiplied for damage type, and so forth. Should it matter, the effects are consistent with the original attack’s damage type. For instance, enough continuing injury from a burning attack would reduce someone to charcoal, while the same HP loss to cutting injury would leave ground meat.
 When imbuing an attack that has a linked or follow-up effect, you must specify which part of the attack is continuing. You can’t enhance more than one part of a linked attack, or both a carrier and its follow-up attack.
 Unless your Imbue advantage is Cosmic (+50% or +300%), you must specify some reasonably obvious way to halt the continuing injury: dousing flame, picking out grubs, applying disinfectant to rotting flesh, etc. This isn’t likely to matter for short intervals, of course!

**Crippling Blow**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 Lets you envenom your weapon or make a pressure-point strike in such a way that a living victim may suffer a physical Affliction (p. B40), as if your attack had a Side Effect (p. B109). If any damage penetrates the target’s DR, he must make a HT roll, at -1 per 2 points of penetrating damage, or suffer a harmful effect. A blow that doesn’t penetrate does nothing.
 The default effect of a failed HT roll is that the target is stunned. He may roll vs. HT at the same penalty every turn to recover. More potent Afflictions give a penalty to your Crippling Blow roll, but last for minutes equal to the victim’s margin of failure.

 Modifiers: -1 per -2 to ST or HT; -1 per -1 to DX; -1 per -10 points of physical disadvantages (but never exotic or racial effects); -2 for Coughing or Moderate Pain; -3 for Nauseated; -4 for Severe Pain; -5 for Retching; -6 for Terrible Pain; -10 for Agony or Choking; and -15 for total Paralysis. You can combine several effects.

**Dancing Weapon**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 You can cast your weapon into the air to fight on its own. This is like any other use of an Imbuement Skill: it takes no preparation, requires 1 FP, and calls for a skill roll at the usual modifiers. You cannot “stack” Dancing Weapon with any other Imbuement Skill, though, because once you activate it, the weapon isn’t ready in your hand!
 On the turn you activate the skill, the weapon fights on its own at a skill level equal to your Dancing Weapon skill. Its Basic Move equals your own, and its damage is identical to what it would do in your hands. It engages any one opponent you indicate, executing Attack maneuvers to strike him when he’s within range or Reach, and Move maneuvers to get to him when he isn’t. This leaves you free to do something else.
 Enemies can attack the weapon at penalty equal to its SM. It can dodge at (Dancing Weapon/2) + 3, at -1 per defense after the first. Use its usual DR and HP to determine breakage. If a foe manages to seize it (a grapple with DX or an unarmed grappling skill, still with SM penalties), the imbuement ends immediately and your enemy acquires a new weapon!
 On later turns, you may pay 1 FP to keep the weapon fighting . . . or not. If you don’t, the weapon’s effective skill drops by one, cumulative from turn to turn. Should skill ever fall below 3, the imbuement ends and the weapon falls to the ground wherever it may be. The only way to erase the skill penalty or “revive” the weapon is to grab it and reactivate the skill.
 To recover a still-active weapon, it has to be within your reach and you must take a Ready maneuver. This requires no success roll (and Fast-Draw isn’t allowed). If it’s on the ground, pick it up normally.

**Drugged Weapon**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 The weapon or its projectile carries a tranquilizing agent, or isn’t “drugged” at all but strikes nonlethal pressure points. Such an attack gains a 1-point follow-up fatigue attack that obeys the rules for the Follow-Up modifier (p. B105). If the weapon attack fails to penetrate DR, its follow-up does nothing!

 Modifiers: Higher fatigue damage gives a penalty of -1 for 1d-2, -2 for 1d-1, -3 for 1d, -4 for 1d+1, -5 for 1d+2, -6 for 2d-1, -7 for 2d, -8 for 2d+1, -9 for 2d+2, or -10 for 3d; minimum damage is 1 point in all cases.

**Electric Weapon**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 The weapon crackles with electricity and gains the Surge modifier (p. B105). Targets such as electronics and robots with electrical systems that take over 1/3 HP from it must make a HT roll to avoid shorting out. Failure disables the target for seconds equal to the margin of failure; critical failure disables it until repaired. A critical hit with the charged-up weapon has the same effect as a critically failed HT roll.
 On an unmodified skill roll, the surge is the only effect.

 Modifiers: To add follow-up electrical burning damage, roll at -1 for 1d-4, -2 for 1d-3, -3 for 1d-2, -4 for 1d-1, -5 for 1d, -6 for 1d+1, -7 for 1d+2, -8 for 2d-1, -9 for 2d, or -10 for 2d+1. In all cases, minimum damage is 1 point and metal armor is treated as DR 1 vs. the follow-up if the carrier attack doesn’t penetrate.

**Envenomed Weapon**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 The weapon or its projectile becomes envenomed. Such an attack gains a 1-point follow-up toxic attack that obeys the rules for the Follow-Up modifier (p. B105). If the weapon attack fails to penetrate DR, its follow-up does nothing!

 Modifiers: Higher toxic damage gives a penalty of -1 for 1d-2, -2 for 1d-1, -3 for 1d, -4 for 1d+1, -5 for 1d+2, -6 for 2d-1, -7 for 2d, -8 for 2d+1, -9 for 2d+2, or -10 for 3d; minimum damage is 1 point in all cases.

**Far Shot**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Far Shot gives a ranged weapon more range, most often by stabilizing its flight via some form of telekinesis or force control. An unmodified skill roll doubles both 1/2D and Max.

 Modifiers: -2 to multiply 1/2D and Max by 5, -4 to multiply by 10, -6 to multiply by 20, -8 to multiply by 50, -10 to multiply by 100, and so on.

**Forceful Blow**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.
 
 This skill enhances a damaging weapon’s knockback (p. B378) – usually via focused chi or psychokinetic force. The attack effectively gains the Double Knockback modifier (p. B104).
 For a crushing weapon, use double the damage rolled to find knockback. For other weapons, calculate knockback as if using a regular crushing weapon. Damage type and amount are unaffected; Forceful Blow only changes knockback.

**Ghostly Weapon**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.
 
 Gives the weapon the Affects Insubstantial enhancement (p. B102), allowing it to affect ghosts and other insubstantial foes.

**Guided Weapon**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Guided Weapon lets you control a projectile after releasing it, guiding it to its target with magical whistling, telekinesis, etc. This works just like the Guided enhancement (p. B106): the attack ignores range penalties and the projectile moves at 1/2D yards/second – regardless of its normal speed – until it hits the target or reaches Max range. Against distant targets, you must take a Concentrate maneuver on turns after the first to control your weapon.

 Modifiers: -1 if you can turn the projectile around for a second attack next turn, at the original effective skill level, in the event that your target dodges the first one; -2 to get a third pass; and so on.

 Guided Weapon cannot be combined with Conic Blast, Multi-Shot, Shockwave, or any other skill that affects multiple targets by default. It guides one attack to one target.

**Homing Weapon**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 Homing Weapon lets a projectile guide itself to a target using any one sense that you yourself possess. You must take an Aim maneuver and make an unmodified weapon skill roll to “lock on,” but you can ignore all ranged combat modifiers except for effects that obscure the chosen sense. The weapon then homes in on its target as if it had the Homing enhancement (p. B106): it ignores range penalties and moves at 1/2D yards/second – regardless of its usual speed – until it hits the target or reaches Max range.

 Modifiers: -1 to enable the projectile to try a second attack next turn, at the original effective skill level, should the target dodge the first one; -2 for a third pass; and so on.

 Homing Weapon cannot be combined with Conic Blast, Multi-Shot, Shockwave, or any other skill that affects multiple targets. You can only lock one shot onto one target at a time.
 You can’t combine Guided Weapon with Homing Weapon, either. The chief benefit of the latter over the former is that it doesn’t require you to take Concentrate maneuvers when engaging foes that require multiple turns (or multiple passes) to hit.

**Incendiary Weapon**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 The weapon or its projectile is wreathed in flame; in effect, it acquires the Incendiary modifier (p. B105). Treat such attacks as if they had a 1-point burning attack as a follow-up (if any damage penetrates DR, the target suffers 1 HP of extra fire injury). The real benefit here is that the weapon can retain its original damage type but still set fires!
 A burning attack enjoys the same bonus injury – but since it can already set fires, the odds of that increase. Move the effective flammability class of anything damaged up one step. See Making Things Burn (p. B433).

 Modifiers: -2 per additional flammability class shift (maximum five shifts – or four for a burning attack, which already gets one free shift). Higher burning damage gives a penalty of - 1 for 1d-3, -2 for 1d-2, -3 for 1d-1, -4 for 1d, -5 for 1d+1, -6 for 1d+2, -7 for 2d-1, -8 for 2d, -9 for 2d+1, or -10 for 2d+2; minimum damage is 1 point in all cases.

**Multi-Shot**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.

 You can supernaturally split your projectile(s) in midair, increasing RoF. For missile weapons, this uses up only the usual number of shots. For thrown weapons, you just need to have one weapon to hurl. In either case, the additional shots last for long enough to do harm and then vanish – if you go downrange to retrieve ammo (or someone examines the scene), you will only find the number of projectiles present before the split.
 A Multi-Shot attack effectively gains the Rapid Fire modifier (p. B108). Not all shots will necessarily find targets. Follow the rules under Rapid Fire (p. B373).
 An unmodified skill roll gives +1 to weapon RoF. This gives most thrown and low-tech missile weapons RoF 2 and most repeating handguns RoF 4. You need RoF 5+ to use Spraying Fire or Suppression Fire (both p. B409).

 Modifiers: -1 per additional +1 to RoF, with no limit. If your skill is high enough to deal with -18, you’re certainly welcome to try for a RoF 20 bowshot!

**Penetrating Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 The weapon hardens, becomes partly insubstantial, or does something else that lets it pass through DR, giving it the Armor Divisor enhancement (p. B102). The basic armor divisor is (2), but this can be improved by taking a penalty to the roll. This is cumulative with targeting chinks in armor (p. B400).

 Modifiers: -2 for (3), -4 for (5), -6 for (10), -8 for (100), and - 10 to bypass DR completely.

**Project Blow**
 Melee; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 The melee weapon delivers its usual damage from a distance – typically by projecting chi, psychokinetic force, or similar. This ranged attack has Acc 3, Range 10/100, RoF 1, Shots N/A, Bulk -2, and Recoil 1. Use the usual melee combat skill for the attack, not a ranged combat skill. Project Blow doesn’t unready the weapon for melee use.

 Modifiers: -10 if used again immediately on the same turn, -9 the next turn, -8 in two turns, -7 in three, -6 in four, -5 in five, -4 in six, -3 in seven, -2 in eight, -1 in nine, and no penalty after 10 turns. Restart the counter after each use.

**Shattershot**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Shattershot causes the projectile of a damaging ranged weapon to rupture on impact, scattering harmful fragments. The attack gains the Fragmentation modifier (p. B104). Note that this destroys the projectile – be sure you want to sunder reusable ammo like an arrow or a spear!
 An unmodified skill roll gives fragments that inflict 1d cutting damage – or burning damage, if the modified weapon is burning, incendiary, or simply on fire. The fragments attack everybody within 5 yards as explained under Fragmentation Damage (p. B414). Note that hits aren’t guaranteed, cover protects, and victims may dodge.

 Modifiers: -2 for 2d damage attacking everyone within 10 yards, -4 for 3d damage and 15 yards, -6 for 4d damage and 20 yards, -8 for 5d damage and 25 yards, or -10 for 6d damage and 30 yards. However, fragment damage can never exceed the underlying attack’s basic damage.

 Shattershot cannot be combined with Conic Blast.

**Shockwave**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 The weapon launches explosive attacks. With a melee weapon, you smash your hands together, drive the charged-up weapon into the ground, or something similar, causing a blast that is centered on you but doesn’t harm you; make a combat skill roll to execute this move, but don’t attack a specific foe. For a ranged weapon, the projectile blows up or causes a massive shockwave wherever it hits; check for scatter (p. B414).
 Treat the weapon’s damage as if it had the Explosion modifier (p. B104), regardless of damage type. Divide damage by three times the distance in yards to each target.

 Modifiers: -5 to divide by twice the distance in yards or -10 to divide by the distance in yards.

 Shockwave cannot be combined with Conic Blast.

**Stealthy Attack**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.
 
 You can silence your weapon or make it invisible, as if it had Low or No Signature (p. B106). An unmodified skill roll gives -2 to all Perception rolls to notice the attack.

 Modifiers: -1 per additional -2 to Perception rolls, to a limit of -4 to skill giving -10 to Per.

**Stupefying Blow**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 Lets you envenom your weapon or make a pressure-point strike in such a way that a living victim may suffer a mental Affliction (p. B40), as if your attack had a Side Effect (p. B109). If any damage penetrates the target’s DR, he must make a Will roll, at -1 per 2 points of penetrating damage, or suffer the bad effect. A blow that fails to penetrate does nothing.
 The default effect of a failed Will roll is that the foe is mentally stunned. He may roll vs. Will at the same penalty every turn to recover. More potent Afflictions give a penalty to your Stupefying Strike roll, but last for 1 minute times the victim’s margin of failure.

 Modifiers: -1 per -1 to DX or IQ; -1 per -10 points of mental disadvantages (but never self-imposed ones; see p. B121); -1 for Tipsy; -2 for Drunk; -3 for Euphoria; -5 for Daze or Hallucinating; -10 for Ecstasy or Seizure; and -15 for Sleep. You can combine several effects.

**Sudden Death**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Sudden Death gives the weapon a type of Delay enhancement (p. B105). Resolve the weapon attack normally and work out what injury or other baneful effects your victim would suffer, given the damage roll, DR, damage type, etc. But don’t apply these when you deal the blow! Instead, they happen on your command, at any future point and from any distance.

 Modifiers: -5 if the damage occurs when a certain condition is met, such as “when the victim next sleeps,” rather than when you actively choose to trigger it.

 You must specify some way to neutralize the pending effect. Typical options are the Esoteric Medicine skill for chi effects, the Remove Curse spell for magical effects, the Exorcism skill for spirit effects, or the Neutralize Poison spell for a toxin. To be valid, this measure has to be one that exists in your game world.
 You can always cancel the pending effect permanently at any time, from any distance, instead of activating it.

**Supreme Control**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.
 
 You can make a damaging strike so precisely that it has only some of its effects – the ones you want – and not the others. This is valuable when you’re interested in shoving things around (knockback) but not breaking things (injury), for instance. An unmodified roll lets you avoid one of blunt trauma (see No Blunt Trauma, p. B111), DR reduction (if making a corrosion attack), fire hazard (if making a burning attack), knockback (see No Knockback, p. B111), or wounding (see No Wounding, p. B111).

 Modifiers: -2 per additional feature switched off after the first.

**Telescoping Weapon**
 Melee; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.
 
 You can cause your melee weapon to change length briefly by physically altering it instead of changing grips. This allows it to hit a foe who’s out of reach, or enables you to fight in close quarters without the usual penalties. In effect, you’re able to adjust your weapon’s intrinsic Melee Attack limitation (p. B112).
 An unmodified roll increases or reduces Reach by 1 yard. Allowed Reach categories are, in order: C, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

 Modifiers: -2 for ±2 yards, -4 for ±3 yards, or -6 for ±4 yards. Final Reach must fall within the C-4 range.

**Traumatic Blow**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.

 Enhances a damaging weapon’s blunt trauma (p. B379) – possibly via a momentary density increase or an armor deforming force field. In effect, the attack gains the Double Blunt Trauma modifier (p. B104).
 Crushing weapons do 1 HP of blunt trauma per 2 points of basic damage resisted by flexible armor. Cutting, impaling, and piercing ones cause 1 HP of blunt trauma per 5 points of basic damage. Other weapons only inflict 1 HP of blunt trauma per 10 points of basic damage.

### Transformation Skills
These Imbuement Skills change the fundamental nature of your weapon. You cannot combine them with each other. You can combine them with Enhancement Skills (pp. 6-11).

**Binding Shot**
 Ranged; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 Lets you convert a damaging ranged attack into a Binding (p. B40). The projectile trails silk, sprouts tendrils, turns to goo, etc., tying up the target. Roll your usual damage dice and read the result as the Binding’s ST – no actual damage occurs. The Binding’s DR is ST/3, rounded down.

 Modifiers: You can add certain Binding modifiers by rolling at a penalty: -2 for Sticky, -6 for Engulfing, and/or -8 for Constricting or Suffocating.

**Burning Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 The weapon or its projectile turns to flame or a scorching heat blast, converting the damage of a non-burning attack from its usual damage type to burning. For most attacks, the main benefit is that you can set fires. For impaling or piercing weapons, you end up with a tight-beam burning attack, which can target vital areas.

**Chilling Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 This skill turns the weapon into some sort of cold projector or even a blade of chilling negative energy. Roll damage as usual but interpret it as fatigue damage that works like the FP loss described for Cold (p. B430), which is difficult to recover from. In effect, this grants the Freezing modifier (p. B104).

**Corrosive Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 Coats the weapon in acid, turns it into a disintegrator, or otherwise converts the damage of a non-corrosion attack from its usual damage type to corrosion. Doing so halves the basic damage rolled, however.

 Modifiers: -2 for 60% damage instead of 50% damage; -4 for 70% damage; -6 for 80% damage; -8 for 90% damage; or -10 for full damage.

**Crushing Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.
 
 Blunts the weapon or engulfs it in a broad force field, converting the damage of a non-crushing attack from its usual damage type to crushing. This lets it work with other Imbuement Skills that function best with crushing attacks, improves knockback (p. B378) and blunt trauma (p. B379), and lets a deadlier weapon “merely” beat a victim senseless.

**Cutting Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Narrows or sharpens the weapon in one dimension, converting the damage of a non-cutting attack from its usual damage type to cutting. Good for severing limbs.

**Dazzling Display**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Lets you convert a damaging attack to Obscure (p. B40) directed at vision. A melee weapon becomes a shaft of darkness or brilliance, or generates a visible shockwave that warps light, affecting a two-yard radius or a radius equal to its Reach, whichever is larger, on any turn when you use this skill; this effect is centered on you. A projectile fills a two-yard radius with darkness, glare, smoke, or something similar where it hits, which lasts 10 seconds.
 Roll your usual damage dice and halve the result (round down). Read this as the Vision penalty, to a maximum of -10. No actual damage occurs.

 Modifiers: You can add the Defensive modifier (the Vision penalty doesn’t affect you) by rolling at -5.

**Deafening Display**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.
 
 Lets you convert a damaging attack to Obscure (p. B40) directed at hearing. A melee weapon cracks, hums, rattles, etc., making a din that affects two-yard radius or a radius equal to its Reach, whichever is larger, on any turn when you use this skill; this effect is centered on you. A projectile goes off like a string of firecrackers or otherwise makes a racket, making hearing difficult in a two-yard radius for the next 10 seconds.
 Roll your usual damage dice and halve the result (round down). Read this as the Hearing penalty, to a maximum of -10. No actual damage occurs.

 Modifiers: You can add the Defensive modifier (the Hearing penalty doesn’t affect you) by rolling at -5.

**Fatiguing Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Winds the target by hitting nonlethal pressure points, charges the weapon with a kind of stunner field, or otherwise converts the damage of a non-fatigue attack from its usual damage type to fatigue.

**Impaling Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 Greatly narrows or sharpens the weapon in two dimensions, converting the damage of a non-impaling attack from its usual damage type to impaling. This gives -1 per die on the basic damage roll, however.

 Modifiers: -5 for full damage.

**Piercing Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 2.
 
 Gives the weapon a narrow-but-blunt profile by reshaping it, projecting a force field, etc., converting the damage of a non-piercing attack from its ordinary damage type to piercing. This improves blunt trauma for most non-crushing attacks and allows crushing attacks to target vital areas.

 Modifiers: +2 for small piercing, -2 for large piercing, or -5 for huge piercing.

**Strike of Negation**
 Melee; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3 with suitable power modifier.
 
 Lets you deal a melee attack that neutralizes a specific group of supernatural effects instead of causing damage. Normally, the effects canceled are those that have the same source as your Imbue advantage; e.g., magic spells, if your Imbue is Magical. However, if the source of your Imbue is split into clearly opposed powers – for instance, Moral (-20%) typically has Good and Evil powers – then the Strike negates effects associated with the power that opposes yours. And if your Imbue is Cosmic, the Strike can negate any one source at a time (choose when you roll) at the +50% level, or all paranormal effects at once at the +300% level! Fighters with “wild” forms of Imbue can’t learn the Strike at all.
 If your attack hits, roll its usual damage dice. Treat the result as the effective skill of the “dispel.” Roll a Quick Contest of this “dispel skill” vs. the skill used to activate each ongoing effect of the correct type on the target; victory means that a temporary effect (like most spells) is dissipated for good while a permanent one (like an enchantment) ceases to work for minutes equal to margin of victory.
 If the target has active, ongoing effects due to advantages in the affected category, also roll a Quick Contest against his Will. Victory means that all such advantages are shut off until he reactivates them.

 Modifiers: -4 to target one specific ongoing effect on the target.

 Strike of Negation offers a unique option: if the user is capable of two or more attacks per turn with his weapon, and one of these hits and wounds the target, then he can waive a later attack on that turn to roll against Strike of Negation with the usual modifiers and FP cost. If it works, roll the Quick Contests above. Effective skill of the “dispel” is the earlier attack’s basic damage roll or the injury that attack caused, whichever is higher.

**Toxic Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 1.
 
 Sprays poison, strikes lethal pressure points, or otherwise converts the damage of a non-toxic attack from its usual damage type to toxic. Toxic damage only harms living things and has no special damage effects – but it also leaves no bruises or, in this case, any other evidence!

**Vampiric Weapon**
 Melee; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 You’re capable of converting the injury you inflict with a melee weapon into a “life force drain” that can heal your own injuries. For every full 3 HP of injury your weapon inflicts on a living victim, you heal 1 HP. You can’t raise your HP above normal.

 Modifiers: -5 to heal 1 HP per full 2 HP of injury, or -10 to heal 1 HP per HP of injury; -5 to “heal” an Energy Reserve instead of HP at the same rate, if your Imbue advantage has a power modifier and you have an ER for that power.

**Withering Strike**
 General; DX/Very Hard
 Default: Specialty for related weapon at same penalty as weapon default.
 Prerequisite: Imbue 3.
 
 This skill’s effects are obviously supernatural: The weapon penetrates DR as usual but leaves no wound. Instead, it visibly drains the target’s vital bodily fluids. Roll damage as usual but interpret it as fatigue damage that works like the FP loss under Dehydration (p. B426). This skill gives the Dehydration modifier (p. B104), in effect.

### Combination Skills
A nice thing about Imbuement Skills is that you can mix and match them as noted in Multiple Skills. For instance, if you know Burning Strike (Unarmed) and Project Blow (Unarmed), then each turn you can choose to barbeque enemies in close combat with burning punches, or project crushing punches, or blast distant targets with fire. But this flexibility doesn’t suit every character concept. What if you want only the ability to hurl fireballs that do punching damage?

The solution is a Combination Skill. Construct such a skill by choosing two or more compatible Imbuement Skills whose effects you wish to combine and merging them into a single skill with a fitting name; e.g., “Project Burning Strike.” This custom Imbuement Skill is DX/VH like the any other, and has the highest Imbue level prerequisite among the skills involved. It counts as one skill if you have Limited Skill Access on your Imbue advantage.

Combination Skills have both upsides and downsides. The biggest benefit is that they cost fewer points: you can buy just one skill instead of two and pay half as much, one skill instead of three and pay 1/3 as much, and so on. Another nice feature is that one roll produces the effects of all the merged Imbuement Skills, which means that high skill makes your combined imbuement more reliable.

The most significant drawback is that you can’t separate the skills. For instance, that Project Burning Strike skill always shoots ranged fireballs with a “cool down” penalty between uses; you can’t give yourself burning fists or hurl ordinary crushing punches.

Another downside is that the cost to use the skill is 1 FP per merged skill (although critical failure still only costs 2 FP). For instance, Project Burning Strike costs 2 FP – and Project Penetrating Burning Strike would cost 3 FP. It’s still possible to reduce this cost, but at -5 to skill per -1 FP.

A further difficulty is that while you can generate all the effects of every constituent skill, the penalties for “advanced applications” listed for both skills apply to the single skill roll. Between this and FP reduction, points you save by not buying multiple skills might well end up spent anyway – to get your Combination Skill to the level where it’s as effective as two separate skills.

Finally, note that while Combination Skills can be “stacked” with other Imbuement Skills, you can’t use them with any skill that isn’t compatible with a constituent skill – the incompatibility extends to the entire Combination Skill. For instance, if you know both Project Burning Strike and Impaling Strike, you can’t project impaling strikes, because Burning Strike and Impaling Strike are both Transformation Skills, and thus exclusive.

The GM has the final say on whether Combination Skills are allowed, which ones exist, and whether players can define their own.

# Travel
An adventurer's goals often take them outside of their starting town. If the course of a journey lacks importance or even sufficient risk, the GM is encouraged to skip as much as they can. Though it is also important, in making the world feel dangerous and lived in, to have encounters on the road. Below are rules for how to handle these journeys when called for.
## Getting There Quickly
The pace of the party is the Move of the slowest member times 10 Miles per day.

Delvers must carry, forage, or conjure three meals apiece per day of travel. If they eat less, they’ll be missing 1 FP per skipped meal (and 1 HP per FP below 0!) on arrival. A few hours of rest won’t restore these FP. This FP penalty will persist until the group rests with food for one day per 3 FP lost – easy in town, risky at the dungeon doors.

Typically, the GM will roll daily for random encounters, be those bandits, dire wombats, or friendly merchants. More days mean more chances to get killed!

Thus, it’s important to minimize travel time. There are three tricks for this. For each, any success knocks 10% off travel time, failure adds 10%, and critical failure adds 20%. The results are additive, giving from -30% to +60% travel time. The party can opt out of any of these rolls.

**The Golden Path**: If the party appoints a guide, that person can make a Navigation roll (at -5 with just the shadows of the trees, -1 with a sundial, or no modifier with a compass) to pick an optimal route over the best terrain.

**Wind at Your Back**: If the guide has Weather Sense, a successful roll lets the party walk or sail with the wind, avoid storms . . . whatever. This is fantasy weather!

**Forced March**: If the party is traveling overland, everyone can try Hiking, Riding, or Skiing, as appropriate, to move quickly; use the worst result. On water, one hero can roll against Boating for a small craft, Seamanship for a large one, to make good time.
## Foraging
Rations are expensive, and cumbersome to lug around (you have to bring enough to make the return trip!). Next to magic, foraging is the best way around that. Only a traveler who knows Fishing, Naturalist, or Survival – no defaults – can forage in a world with killer bunnies and man-eating shrubs. Roll once per trip.

Success means the adventurer needs only half as much food from rations; e.g., 60 meals instead of 120 on a 40-day journey. Critical success means the delver can either consume no rations or halve the rations used by himself and one companion.

Failure still means some good days – but mostly bad ones. The traveler needs only 2/3 as many rations. Critical failure means relying on rations like everyone else. This is probably a disaster: an outdoorsman counting on foraging and carrying less food will be half-dead after a long trip – or the whole party will be weak, if they’re nice and share their food.
## Camping and Posting Watches
Camping requires no special skill, but the party should post watches. The order isn’t important; when a nighttime encounter occurs, the GM will randomly determine whose watch it interrupts, and secretly roll against the higher of Perception or Observation for that PC. This becomes a Quick Contest against the Stealth skill of sneaky enemies.

If the watch-keeper succeeds (wins, in a Contest), the party isn’t surprised – although those who were asleep start combat lying down. Otherwise, everyone is asleep or stunned; each delver must make one IQ roll per turn, at +1 per turn after the first and +6 for Combat Reflexes, and can react only on the turn after succeeding.

**Wilderness Camps**: If a nighttime encounter involves enemies that hunt by sight, the GM will roll a Quick Contest: the monsters’ Vision vs. the party’s highest Camouflage skill, at a penalty equal to the number of party members who have no points in that skill. Victory means the enemy spends enough time searching that any watch-keeper gets a second chance to detect them, as above. If the watcher succeeds on both perception checks then the party has enough time to start the fight standing but not readied.

**Dungeon Camps**: When sleeping in a dungeon, camouflage won’t work – but if the room has doors, use the same rules with the party’s highest Traps (and no penalty) to set simple noise-makers. In that case, victory means the monsters awaken the party; the delvers won’t be surprised. Sleeping heroes still start combat lying down, though.

# Guilds and Organisations
### Membership benefits
Members of a guild can petition their organization for assistance on their quests. A wizard can consult with his colleagues for information on the haunted swamps he intends to visit, a knight can make sure he gets the sharpest sword from the castle armory, and so on. Petitioners may make an assistance roll (AR), a roll on 3d with a chance of success depending on Rank; see the Assistance Roll Table. In addition, if a guild is sponsoring a quest, members of the adventuring party who aren’t members of the guild may still request assistance as though they were Rank 0.

If several PCs in the same guild request the same help, roll once for the person of highest Rank, adding 1/5 of the total Rank of the others (rounded down) to his Rank. For instance, a Rank 3 underboss in the thieves’ guild, two Rank 2 capos, and a Rank 1 footpad would roll as if their Rank were 3 + (2 + 2 + 1)/5 = 4.

Requests for assistance must be made when an adventurer is in contact with his guild. Since many adventures involve tramping through the wilderness and into remote, dangerous places, this usually means seeking assistance before or after an adventure, much like shopping for equipment. Magicians, mentalists, and others with long distance communication capabilities may be able to “phone home” for information and advice, but the difficulty involved in travel usually means that physical assistance isn’t an option for those already in the field.
#### Modifiers
Odds of assistance are low for low-ranking guild members, but an AR is a success roll, subject to Luck. Several bonuses may apply. Of course, there may be penalties, and if modified AR falls below 3, there’s no chance.

- Person requesting aid has Charisma: +Charisma. ‡
- Person requesting aid makes a suitable skill roll for the organization (see individual guild descriptions for specific skills): +2 for critical success, +1 for success, -1 for failure, or -2 for critical failure.
- Previous requests by team this adventure: -1 per AR after first.
- Request especially appropriate to situation: +1 to +5. †
- Request especially inappropriate to situation: -1 to -10, and failure by 10+ or critical failure means disciplinary action. †
- Specific modifiers: See individual guild descriptions for modifiers that apply instead of or as well as those for appropriateness.

 ‡ Charisma only applies to requests in person, not those made by letter or magical scrying stone.
 
 † The GM judges what’s appropriate or inappropriate. A wounded Rank 0 recruit might get +5 when shouting for a cleric to heal him, while even a Rank 8 grand high priest would have -10 to request the unsealing of the ancient demon seals “just because.”
### Assistance Roll Table

| **Rank** | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Military Company
**Rank**: Military Rank 0-8.

**In Charge**: Knights.

**In the Ranks**: Barbarians, brutes, guards, holy warriors, knights, martial artists, scouts, skirmishers, squires, and swashbucklers.

**On Payroll**: Bards, clerics, druids, innkeepers, and wizards.

**Influencing the AR**: Leadership.

Both freelance mercenary organizations and standing state armies are commonplace in worlds where adventure is a viable career choice. They provide fighters of all kin with potential employment and a structure to give them contacts and other social support. But their narrow focus can lead them to engage outsiders for specialized work.
#### Who Military Companies Are
Military companies are purveyors of armed, physical force, warriors from top to bottom. Military companies attract a lot of knights and scouts, as well as their Henchmen-styled counterparts (archers, squires, skirmishers, and guards) and even a few barbarians, holy warriors, martial artists (particularly the armed varieties), and swashbucklers. They may have a small corps of clerics for healing, wizards for battle magic and miscellaneous supernatural support, and innkeepers to handle provisioning. However, such specialists are typically already working at full capacity to support regular units and can’t be spared for special missions. Most other adventuring types must be hired on a mission-by-mission basis as required.

Depending on the history of the company, they may share a common ethnic or racial origin. A number of historical societies were noted for providing specific types of troops (for example, slingers from the Balearic Islands for the Romans, or horse archers from Central Asia for many Asian nations during the Middle Ages). Dwarves may be noted for their sappers and heavy infantry, while elves may be famous for their scouts and massed archery. However, many military companies have few conditions beyond being able to fight and take orders.

Military companies are strongly hierarchical, with a definite chain of command. Smart commanders listen to their underlings before issuing orders, but then what they say goes. Nevertheless, they have a stake in making sure their subordinates are suitably equipped. Maximum Rank for a single company is 5 or 6, but imperial armies can have Rank as high as 8. Use Leadership to influence ARs.
#### What Military Companies Want
Military companies are in the business of killing things, and they’re very good at doing it with physical force and pointy objects. Members of military companies can look forward to countless missions of violence, and looting bodies and conquered territories is a time-honored perk of being a soldier. Of course, they do so as part of a broader strategy, so they may not understand why they need to occupy a given hill or attack a given position, and the fog of war may leave them ill-equipped to deal with conditions on the ground or deprive them of expected support.

But there are often gaps in coverage for tasks which involve subtlety, negotiation, and the supernatural, and military companies may require auxiliaries to perform support missions or neutral parties to handle sensitive tasks. One common capacity in which military companies engage outsiders is for mixed strike forces. Any number of missions require a strong presence of spellcasters to handle supernatural threats and defenses, and thieves or similar sneaky folk to circumvent obstacles which cannot be overcome by force of arms alone. These may include decapitation strikes against enemy commanders and attempts to gather intelligence about enemy forces and movements.

A military company stretched thin with front-line fighting duties may need assistance in performing key logistical tasks. Adventurers may be called on to escort payrolls through dangerous territory or important prisoners from the battlefield to secure rear areas. Hired associates may be involved in missions closer to the front lines for which warriors are poorly suited. Thieves, ninja, and assassins may be prized for their ability to sneak behind enemy lines to gather intelligence, while bards can travel relatively openly, convincingly lying about their true purpose while entertaining opposing forces.
#### What Military Companies Provide
Military companies can give training for traits on the fighter template. Professional items they can supply discounts on include most weapons (excluding disguised weapons and weapons which have only reach C), any armor, and shields.

Military companies can usually respond to these types of ARs:
- Backup. When a military company sends people around to help, they’re trained fighters built on a mix of full knight/holy warrior/scout templates and their closest Henchmen equivalents.
- Maps.
- Mounts and vehicles.
- New gear.
- Provisions.
- Training.
Other ARs are at -3 or worse.
