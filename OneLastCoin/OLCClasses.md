# OLC Classes
## Alchemist
Starting Equipment: 1 Potion of each colour (plus their recipe), a miniature lab (2 slots), a knife.
- A: Lesser Brews, Bombs
- B: Antidotes, Chug
- C: Explosive Infusion
- D: Greater Brews

**Lesser Brews**: You can turn monster corpses into extracts. Each corpse takes 10 minutes to render and is destroyed by the process. Each HD of corpse yields one extract (no partial extractions). There are three different colours of extracts. Animal-based monsters tend to give red extracts; oozes and insects tend to give green extracts; undead monsters tend to give blue extracts.

One extract can be used to make a brew. 6 can be used to learn a new brew with a month's time. Extracts don’t take up inventory slots as long as you have a miniature lab. Brews are a light item.

You can only make brews that you know the recipe for. It takes 10 minutes to make a brew. Brews with the throwable tag can be thrown 30’ and and all brews can be consumed or splashed on targets within 5’. A Brew lasts 10 minutes unless stated otherwise or obviously instantaneous.

**Bombs**: In addition to three starting brews, you also know how to make Bombs. Made the same way as brews, bombs are also light. Throwable up to 30’. Bomb damage ignores armor but not shields. Different extracts have different effects in a 5’ radius (2x2 squares).
- **Blue**: 2d4 damage, on max damage roll targets killed reanimate as mindless killers.
- **Red**: deals 1d6, targets killed explode for 1d4.
- **Green**: deals 1d6 damage, targets killed are transmuted into movement-blocking, writhing vines.

**Antidotes**: You are an expert in antidotes. You can turn any brew into an antidote to itself, which automatically stops ongoing effects. This does not apply to most brews that have instant effects. 

**Chug**: Through uncomfortable route practice you can drink faster than most people, especially thick and vile brews. You can consume a single brew as a free action per round.

**Explosive Infusion**: You can combine your bombs and brews together. When a brew-infused bomb explodes, its effects apply to the targets. You can choose whether the brew-bomb deals damage on its creation.

**Greater Brews**: You can harvest greater extracts from creatures that are HD 4 or higher (1 extract per 4 HD). It takes one greater extract to make a greater brew and 4 to learn a new greater brew. They take 10 minutes to extract and each one can be converted to 3 lesser extractions.

## Deserter
**Starting Equipment**: Light armour, a shield bearing your former affiliation, a 1 slot weapon, a weight on your conscience, and good boots.
- You get an additional +1 HP at A and C.

- **B:** Patchwork, Fleet of Foot
- **C:** Unperturbed, Good Boots
- **D:** Danger Sense, Piece Meal

**Parry**: You may Gamble your Weapon Dice as Armor Dice. Doing so either before or after Gambling Armour.

**Well-Travelled:** You've been everywhere since you ran away. You can read road signs in any Tongue, and whenever bidding knowledge if you do not have an applicable background you may spend a Brain Die to get information as if you did.

**Basic Training:** You always add 1d4 to Saves during combat.

**Patchwork**: At the end of Combat you reroll any lost Armour Dice, gaining them back on the highest result. 

**Fleet of Foot:** When running away from a fight you suffer only 1 Stress.

**Unperturbed:** You've seen a lot, both before and after you defected. You add 1d4 to saves against fear, and so do your allies if you roll and succeed first.

**Good Boots**: You also suffer 1 less Stress as if you where on a mount, this does not stack if you have a mount.

**Danger Sense:** You have a good nose for when things are about to go south. You can't be surprised, and make a free melee attack at the start of combat at someone or something, regardless of initiative.

**Piece Meal**: When rolling Armour Dice for Patchwork, gain the Dice back on the highest 2 results. Patchwork now also applies to Weapon and Shield dice lost.


## Rat King
Starting Equipment: Icon of the Rat King, Sling, Cheese (3), Lockpicks
- You get an additional max rat at B and D.
- **A:** Rat Friend, Call Rat  
- **B:** Throw Rat, Rat Mapping
- **C:** Rat Bullet, Dire Rat
- **D:** Transfer Affliction

**A: Rat Friend**  
You begin play with a variant of Faelul called Ratspat. You can use it to speak freely with all rodents and unlike faelul they may respond, though in broken tongue.

Additionally all rodents recognize you as the beloved rat king, and will improve their starting attitude toward you one step. This protection doesn't extend to your friends.

**A: Call Rat**
You tap on walls, sing a song, or emit a high-pitched squeak. If there are rats nearby (and there are nearly always rats) a rat who is loyal to the rat king will emerge from somewhere nearby and join you. Calling a rat incurs a roll on the Underworld Die.

Rats who are loyal, obey you because they are _terrified_ to disobey the rat king for reasons they struggle to explain. They obey you unhesitatingly, although they require a slice of cheese if given obviously suicidal orders.

The maximum number of rats that you can summon per day is equal to 3 times your level. However, the maximum number of rats you can have under your control is equal to your level, with an additional at B and D. Rats who are out on missions for you (such as carrying messages or mapping) still count towards this limit.

**B: Throw Rat**  
You can throw your rats as weapons. The rat becomes attached.

Each attached rat does 1 point of damage per turn. A rat can be pulled off and held with a +4 Save. A held rat can be crushed in your hand as a free action.

**B: Rat Mapping**
You can send your rats into a dungeon to map it. This takes 20 minutes per room explored, but is relatively low risk. Choose how many rats you want to send in, and remember that you are still limited by how many rats you can control at once.

Rooms are described primarily through smells as well as a general sense of "good place", "bad place", or "indifferent" based on whether or not the room contains anything of interest to a rat. Because rats are stupid, lazy, easily confused, and really bad at passing messages along.
	Rats enjoy food, water, safety, warmth, and an abundance of places to hide (such as furniture debris or dirty straw).  Rats don't enjoy fire, noise, large creatures moving around, people talking, or a complete lack of places to hide.

So the map is just a list of circles with lines drawn between them, labeled with the predominant smell of that room (if any), with occasional smiley faces and sad faces, depending on whether the rats did or didn't like the room. 

Rats find all obvious exits to a room.  They have a 2-in-6 chance of finding secret passages. Even if they can't enter it, they can still detect it, and tell you about it.

Your DM will draw your rat map as follows: Get a d6 for every rat sent. Assume that all the rats move into the first room and roll all the d6s. So if you sent in 4 rats, roll 4d6 for the first room.

A result of a 1 or 2 indicates that rat has died, gotten bored, or wandered off.

If you have at least two dice that show a '6', the rats have paid especially good attention to this room, and return with a more useful description of the room. They actually return with a description closer to what a person would describe. They are limited by their language. They have names for all the common monsters, though you may not know them yet.

You don't get to cross-examine the rat about the description.

Then pick up all of the remaining d6s, pick an unexplored path (from any room), and then go through it. Repeat this process for the next room.

[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AoYdlgstvK8/Vm6U8X1cBUI/AAAAAAAAItw/peaCB_Dj1-E/s320/rat%2Bmap.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AoYdlgstvK8/Vm6U8X1cBUI/AAAAAAAAItw/peaCB_Dj1-E/s1600/rat%2Bmap.png)
- an example of what the rat mapping function will return  
- notice that they must have gotten at least two 6s on the first room
- also notice that they have an equal chance of exploring any unexplored room

You can use this ability from within a dungeon, too. Just remember that you're to eat away at the Underclock while you sit there waiting for the stupid rats to come back.

Rats that you use in this way wander off. Mechanically this is the same as all rats used in this way dying.

**C: Rat Bullet**
When you throw a rat you can choose to instead focus on impact. The rat deals 2d4 damage and dies on impact.

**C: Dire Rat**
When you Call Rats you may instead call a dire rat. This counts as 4 rats for the sake of the maximum you can command. This dire rat cannot be thrown or map dungeons but does have the combat prowess to act on their own. You can command them as a free action on your turn but they always go after you and after the enemies. 

**D: Transfer Affliction**
Once per day, you can transfer a disease, poison, or curse onto a willing rat. Your loyal rats always count as willing (although they may curse your name or haunt you).
# Workshop
# Fighters
## Slayer
You are a dedicated warrior, focusing on the killing of your enemies to the exclusion of the development of wider abilities.

**Starting Equipment**: Any weapon of your choice, Light Armour, and either a shield or second weapon.
- A: Critical Hits, Parry
- B: Notches
- C: Called Attack
- D: Cleave

**Critical Hits**: .

**Parry**: You may gamble a weapons damage dice as armor dice like a shield. Weapons Dice may be fixed as armor but if all the Weapons Dice are lost the weapon is lost.

**Notches**: Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below.
- +1 Damage
- Expanded critical range (+1)
- Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon).
Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

**Called attack**: You can choose a particular spot on your target to strike at when attacking. You get a -2 modifier (-4 if it is the head) to your attack roll but if you hit the attack will inflict an additional debilitating effect appropriate for the location.

**Cleave**: When you defeat a foe you may make an additional attack as part of this action. This may only trigger a maximum amount equal to your templates.

## Hunter
- **Starting Equipment**: A bow with ammo, 2 Hand Weapons or a Hefty Weapon.
- A: Silent Walk, Practiced Eye  
- B: scaling
- C: build off, Animal Whisperer  
- D: Camper

**A) Ambush Expert**: When you confront an Omen you always find them in a favourable situation. If you are confronting the Omen outdoors, in nature, you may draw the battle map and choose starting positions.

**A) Practiced Eye**: You may take an action to aim, your next attack against that target has advantage.

**B) Trophies**: You can collect trophies from fresh corpses. Each trophy takes up 1 inventory slot and gives you +1 Armor when you wear it prominently.

**C) Hunter's Mark**: You can mark up to [template] creatures you can see, letting you track them without a roll. If weather or time would make tracking impossible, you can roll for it anyway.

**C) Titan Slayer**: As an action you can use a trophy as a talisman to enhance an attack. Deal +X damage on your next attack, where X is the HD of the creature from which you got the trophy. This consumes the trophy but the bonus damage is dealt even if you miss.

**D) Camper**: Making Camp can be done as part of the first sleep action.
# Wizards  
#### Spell Slots
You have practiced storing spells in you mind as apposed to in living wood. You can keep a number of spells stored in your brain equal to your number of Wizard Templates. Spells prepared in this way do not require a book or wand to cast.

#### Spell Breeding  
You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:  
a) a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)  
b) a random spell from a random spell list  
c) a mutant version of one of the two spells  
  
When the process is complete, Save Cunning -6 or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus for  
a) every 10 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade  
b) the number of Wizard templates you possess  
c) each ritual preparation you describe to the GM 
## Orthodox Wizard

# Specialists
## Thief
**Starting Equipment**: Caltrops, lockpicks, dagger.
- You gain +1 to Stealth for each Thief template you possess.
- A: Always Prepared, Wall Crawler
- B: Lucky, Quick Draw
- C: Backstab
- D: Great Escape, Very Lucky

**Wall Crawler**: You can climb as well without climbing gear as most people can with climbing gear. Simple climbs do not require a test. You can attempt impossible climbs.

**Lucky**: Once per day you may reroll any save and keep the result of your choice

**Deep Pockets**: 2 of your Slots become additional Quick Draw Slots.

**Backstab**: Whenever your attack is bolstered due to surprise or overwhelming your foe you roll +d8 instead of a d6.

**Great Escape**: Once per day, you can automatically escape from something that is restraining you and that you could plausibly escape from. This includes grapples, nooses, pit traps, and awkward social situations, but not sealed coffins.

**Very Lucky**: You may use your Lucky ability twice per day. You may also allow an adjacent ally to use one of your rerolls, provided you could have plausibly assisted them.


# Workshop
## Fighter
Starting Equipment: leather armor, sword, bow, 20 arrows
A: Parry, +1 attack per round
B: Notches
C: Quick Learner, +2 Attack stat
D: Impress, Cleave
You gain +1 HP for each Fighter template you possess.

A: Parry
Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points.

If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12.

B: Notches
Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet.

• +1 Damage
• Expanded critical range (+1)
• Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon).

Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

C: Quick Learner
You can become proficient with a new weapon after 4 successful hits (instead of 8). If your first attack is a critical hit, you immediately become proficient.

D: Impress
Whenever you win a fight against challenging foes, people who don't like you make a new reaction roll with a +4 bonus. This even works on people you just defeated in combat, unless you caused them undeserved or disproportionate harm. Hirelings get a +2 to Morale or a new Save vs Fear.

D: Cleave
Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with an attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a target within 5’. You can only cleave an number of targets equal to your Level in a single round.


## Alchemist
For each Alchemist template, you can use 1 CD per concoction (max 4) You learn two formulas per template (see below).

Starting equipment: Thick leather gloves, dagger, portable lab (2 slot), 2d6 ingredients (see below), lots of vials.
**A**:  Alchemy,  Stabilize, Alchemical tricks
**B**:  Scrounge, Reclamation
**C**:  Potion Maker, Precise Measurements
**D**: Discovery, Immunity

**Alchemy:** An alchemist's wondrous abilities are powered by "special ingredients".  They could be gems, special herbs, dragon scales, rare metals or spices... the exact nature of these can be defined with your GM, or stay vague. A single dose of "special ingredient' is represented by a **Chemical Dice, or CD** and you may fit 4 in a Slot.  These work similarly to Mage Dice (MD).

An alchemist does not cast spells. They create concoctions - potions, bombs, ointments - short term, one-use quasi-magical objects that the alchemist uses to create magic-like effects, based on formulas they know. The more CD the alchemist invests into a concoction, the more powerful it will be. An alchemist therefore needs time to prepare their concoctions in advance.  
  
*Using Concoctions*: Most require 1 action to activate, light a fuse and throw, drink, etc. When a concoction is used; 1d6 is rolled per CD invested during the concoction's reaction, and the effect is based on this result (as MD). On a roll of 1-3, the CD is "returned" to the alchemist - they were stingy with the ingredients, and still has some left. On a 4-6 the CD is lost - more ingredients were used for a bigger bang.   

Other people can use your concoctions, but it is risky - they roll +2d6 that add no power to the effect but can trigger a mishap or doom (see below).

1d6 alchemist mishaps  
1.  The concoction doesn't quite work right and there is a minor explosion or acid splash.  Take 1d6 damage.  
2.  The concoction worked normally, but regain no CDs on a 1-3 for this one.  
3.  Coughing fit for 1d6 round.  
4.  A *hideous* smell is released.  People shout in panic, zombies gag. How embarrassing!  
5.  The fumes give you a vicious headache.  You can use concoctions but are in no shape to prepare new ones for the rest of the day.  
6.  You drop the concoction and it goes off, to potentially disastrous results.  
  
Alchemist Dooms
1.  Countless mishaps have permanently damaged your senses. Lose your sense of smell.  
2.  Exposure to noxious chemicals have affected your health.  Lose 1d3 HP permanently.  
3.  You have contracted a long wasting illness from years of exposure to toxic metals.  Lose 1 HP permanently each month. There are no know cure... but perhaps the Elixir of Life could save you!  But the formula has been long lost...  

_Making concoctions_: A concoction takes 1 hour per CD invested to prepare (some take longer).  This is careful work that needs quiet, some shelter and light to do. Most alchemists carry a portable lab that is sufficient for most alchemical work. If the process is interrupted the CDs are lost. Unlike a wizard, there is no limit to the number of concoctions an alchemist can prepare - but it would not be wise for them to use all their CD in advance, as concoctions are not stable.

Each morning, the concoction **has a 1 in 6 chance of losing one CD of power.**  A concoction with no CD left has fully degraded and is essentially useless. Some alchemists deal with this problem with stabilization (see below).

_Regaining CDs_:  An alchemist starts at level 1 with 2d6 CDs, and gains 1d6 more CDs each time they level up.  Furthermore, when returning to town to re-supply, a level 1 alchemist *can* regain 1d4 CDs, at a cost of 10 gp per CD.  At level 2 and 3 resupplying will yield 1d6 CDs, and a master alchemist will be able to gather 1d8 CDs.

_Formulas:_   An alchemist begins the game with two known formulas, each determined randomly by rolling 1d6 and consulting the list (reroll any duplicates).  At template B they gain two more formulas (roll 1d8 twice), at Template C they gain two more (roll 1d10 twice) and at template D they get another two (roll 1d12 once and select another).  An alchemist can also gain further formulas by consulting alchemical tomes and learning their formulas.  Doing so is difficult, taking a day (or more!) per new formula.

**Stabilize :** To avoid the rapid degradation of a prepared concoction, an alchemist can spend one hour carefully neutralizing it. The concoction, if kept dry and away from extreme temperatures, will remain inert and stable for several years. Another hour of work is required to re-activate it. Once this is done, the concoction cannot be neutralized a second time, and must be used soon or it will degrade (as per standard rules).  

**Alchemical tricks:** You know one of the following minor alchemical feats (and learn one per template).  These do not require CDs:  

- Matches.  You have created small fire sticks, that are useful to start fires.  You can use them to light a fire in most circumstances, or provide candle-level illumination for till light would roll UD. If the precise number of matches becomes important, you have 2d6 matches, and creating a new batch takes 1 hour.

- Small firework display.  A sparkler or 3, a whistler, a half dozen firecrackers, a couple of bottle rockets, a cone fountain... it will entertain the children or make a heck of a distraction.  An alchemist investing large sums and sufficient time could make a display suitable for larger audiences, of course.

- Planetary Charm:  A small plate of lead with protective symbols. They provide you with a +2 save bonus vs a specific thing (fire, fear, brigand attacks, poison, illness....).  Re-aligning the save takes 1 hour but must be done on the proper day of the week (roll 1d7 to determine which day).

**Scrounge**:  An alchemist with _no remaining CDs_ can spend an hour searching an area (a cavern with strange mushrooms, a wooded area, an abandoned lich lab, even a small village) and gain 1 CD.  At template C this increased to 1d2 CD, and at template D this increases to 1d3 CD.  This can only be performed once a day.  This search triggers a roll on the Underclock die. Scrounging is free, unless in a Civilized location.

**Reclamation**:  An alchemist can take apart an already prepared concoction and extract remaining CDs from them. Roll 1d6 per CD, you regain it on a 1-4.  If the concoction is not stabilized, this roll may trigger mishaps/dooms in case of doubles or triples. This process takes an hour.

**Potion Maker**: You learn the craft of making magical potions (potions of healing, giant strength etc). You may craft any potion for half the retail cost. This takes an amount of time equal to a week per 500 GP.

**Precise Measurement**: Instead of rolling, you can decide that a CD will be 2 (you conserved on ingredients) or 5 (you didn't skimp). Not all dice can be determined at least one CD must be random (precise measurement can only be used on 2D or stronger concoctions). Having multiple 2s or 5s can trigger a mishap or doom.

**Discovery**:  You rediscover an ancient secret of the past. You (THE PLAYER) do some research in old grimoires etc, find a formula or spell you like, and transcribe it into the GLOG format. You can do it! Your character will thank you.  

**Immunity:** Years of exposure to strange substances and dangerous experiments have granted you a+3 bonus to saves vs poison, gas, fire or acid.
### Formulas  
1. Fire Projector: This concoction is a tube that projects one or more fiery projectiles, each doing 1d6 points of damage to target and cast light as a torch (it can be use to set fires).  It shoots [dice] number of projectiles.  Hits are automatic within 30 feet, after that an attack roll is required (treat as a ranged weapon with range increment of 30 feet).  The alchemist can set a fast fuse (shooting all projectiles in 1 round) or slow (shoot one per round).  Also known as the Roman Candle.  You can choose the colour of each projectile.  

This concoction is easier to make than most, CDs are regained on 1-4, not 1-3.

2. Alchemical Lard: This concoction is a simple ingredient that can be used in cooking. It creates a number of portions equal to 4x[dice]. It has 0.4 value in each nutrient. Though the Alchemist can add 1 to a nutrient of their choice for each [dice]. This ingredient counts as Exotic for sake of FD. This Concoction does not deteriorate but also cannot return CD on low rolls.

3. Celestial Perfume: This perfume is most auspicious and pleasant, making the wearer seems interesting, charismatic and worthy of assistance. It provides a +4 bonus to an Allure saves and it also keeps miasmas and plagues at bay, providing a +2 bonus to saves vs diseases. Gnomes are particularly fond of the perfume. Once applied, the perfume lasts for [sum] hours.  

4. Smoke Pot: Upon ignition, this clay pot emits copious amounts of smoke, generating a cloud of [dice]x5 feet radius, lasting [sum]/2 round (only 1 round in a stiff wind). By varying the fillers in the pot, the alchemist can choose to generate one of two types of smoke. The smoke can be opaque, blocking vision - the smoke is unpleasant but mostly harmless. Or the smoke can be thinner but noxious. Those inside the infernal stink must make a constitution save or be sickened, suffering a -4 penalty to attack rolls and ability/skill checks while they remain in the smoke and for [dice] thereafter.

An alchemist can choose to have the bomb go off almost immediately after thrown or add a fuse that will delay its activation by up to [dice] rounds.

5.  Vitriol: The alchemist generates [dice] vials of strong acid. This acid can be thrown at an enemy (attack roll required, [sum] damage on round 1 and [dice] damage for the following [dice] rounds). It can also be used to destroy metals (gold is immune) - a single vial is sufficient to wreck a lock, melt an iron bar etc, in about a minute.

This concoction is particularly stable, and only requires a check vs degradation every month.

6.  Theriac: The alchemist takes a large onion, cuts off the top and carefully opens it up. Spices, poisons and other exotic ingredients are inserted between the layers, and the whole thing is slowly and gently cooked in boiling honey. Some alchemists believe that keeping a stabilized Theriac for very long periods of time (years or even decades) enhances the effect - the flavor certainly is something.

This powerful concoction can stop illness or poison dead in their tracks. Upon eating this panacea, the patient may remake a save vs illness or poison with a +4 bonus. Furthermore, they regain 1d3 hp per CD used.

The Theriac takes two hours per CD to prepare, not one.

7. The Great Petard: A metal sphere or tube (or a very thick glass bottle) is filled with fiery ingredients, a fuse is lit, and KABOOM. Does [sum] damage in a 20 feet radius. If well placed against a structure (gate etc) does double damage to the structure (DM should be generous in its breaching power. Something like 1D will blow up a solid door, 2D a postern, 3D a stout postern or a small gate 4D all but the greatest gates). The bomb can be thrown up to 50 feet with a running start. The fuse can be almost immediate, or burn for up to [dice]X2 rounds.

8. Sword of St Germain: This concoction is a bit different from most. A 7 pointed star made of a thin sheet of pure tin is inscribed with potent symbols under the light of the full moon. This star must then be wrapped around the tang of a single handed sword. The grip is then re-installed over the star.

The star will be inert (and stable) for several years until its power is invoked. The user will then be victorious in battle. The sword becomes a +2 weapon for [sum] hours, but only for the alchemist.

9. Mercury invisibility ring: This ring is made with solidified quicksilver and mounted with a small stone found in the nest of a hoopoe. To be used, the ring must be worn with the stone facing outwards - by wearing it with the stone hidden, its power is suppressed. The invisibility granted by the ring lasts [sum]+[dice] minutes, but it can be split up into up to [dice] uses. A violent action by the alchemist, the use of magic, rapid motion (running vs walking) or even loud speech by the alchemist will disrupt the invisibility for 1d6 rounds.

This concoction does not expire (i.e. is stable) until it time/number of uses runs out, when the ring melts. This concoction *must* be prepared on a Wednesday.

10. Killing Miasma: In a glass bottle, the alchemist mixes water, salt, distilled vinegar, old urine, styrax and other things, and exposes it to the light of the sun, then seals with with a good cork and bee's wax. Upon breaking, the vial releases a cloud of noxious fumes, [dice]X5 feet radius, lasting [sum]/2 round. While a strong wind will disperse the cloud in a single round, a gentle breeze will push it along, moving it 1d3X10 feet per round. Anyone inside the cloud take [dice] damage. Furthermore, anyone in the fumes for longer than their hit dice (or level) rounds must make a Brawn Save or die.  Woe upon the alchemist who breaks his bottle by accident. It can be thrown up to 40 feet, 60 with a running start.

11.  Homunculus: The alchemist has gained mastery over life itself! Using clay, bile and a drop of their blood; and with a full day of sculpting and gentle baking, they has created a new living organism, the homunculus.

The homunculus can speak Common. It is not particularly intelligent but is cunning and is able to improvise. It is fairly loyal as long as it's treated reasonably well. Its life span and potency depends on how many CDs were invested:
- 1D  Defense 10, 3 HP, 1d4 dmg, All stats 8.  Lives [sum] hours.
- 2D  Defense 12, HP 5, 1d6 dmg, +4 to stealth check, All stats 10. Lives [sum] days.
- 3D  Defense 13, HP 6, 1d6 dmg, stealth as above + can use a bow.  All stats 11, Lives, [sum] weeks.
- 4D  Defense 14, HP 8, 1d6 dmg, stealth + bow as above, can fly mediocrely, all stats 12, lives [dice] years. Can use your concoctions.

Alchemists hotly contest claims that they are merely hiring small ugly(er) goblins.

12.  Philosopher's stone. The Grand Work. Takes a full month and *must* invest 4 CD for it to work, along with a pound of lead, a pound of silver and one thousand ants, as well as access to a full alchemical lab - a portable one simply won't do. Through a series of sublimations, condensations, combustions, fermentations, precipitations and paying close attention to planetary alignments, the alchemist prepares the philosopher's stone, the culmination of his art, a golden brown stone the size of a baby's fist. This stone is stable until used.  

But what does it do?!? Some say that when crushed and mixed with a pound of lead, it will generate a pound of gold. Some say that if put in the mouth of a creature that recently died (no more than a week ago), the creature will be resurrected. Some say that if shallowed by a dragon, the stone will allow it to assume human form for [sum] days, and that dragons will grant anyone bringing them such a stone a wish. Some say that that if dissolved in a perfect alcohol then drunk, it will instantly grant a wizard template to the drinker.
