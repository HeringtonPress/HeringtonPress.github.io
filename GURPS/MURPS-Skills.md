# MURPS Skills
#### Acrobatics
- DX/Hard
- Default: DX-6.

This is the ability to perform gymnastic stunts, roll, take falls, etc. This can be handy on an adventure, as tightrope walking, human pyramids, and trapeze swinging all have useful applications. Each trick requires a separate skill roll, at whatever penalties the GM sees fit.

You may substitute an Acrobatics roll for a DX roll in any attempt to jump, roll, avoid falling down, etc.

You may attempt an Acrobatic Dodge in combat – a jump or roll that avoids an attack in a flashy way. Before rolling to dodge roll Acrobatics, a success gives you a +2 to your dodge roll where as a failure gives you a -2.

Finally, a successful Acrobatics roll will reduce the effective distance of any fall by five yards (see Falling, b. 431).

Two special versions of Acrobatics are also available:

Aerobatics: The ability to execute tight turns, loops, power dives, etc. in flight. You must be able to fly to learn this skill – although how you fly (magic, wings, jet pack, etc.) is irrelevant. Natural fliers might find flight to be as effortless as humans find walking, but they must still learn Aerobatics in order to engage in complex acrobatics. Add +2 to skill if you have 3D Spatial Sense (p. 34).

Aquabatics: The ability to engage in underwater acrobatics. Prerequisites: Swimming, or the Amphibious advantage (b. 40) or the Aquatic disadvantage (b. 145).

Acrobatics, Aerobatics, and Aquabatics default to one another at -4. Add +1 to these three skills if you have Perfect Balance (b. 74).

#### Acting
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: IQ-5, Performance-2, or Public Speaking-5.

This is the ability to counterfeit moods, emotions, and voices, and to lie convincingly over a period of time. A successful Acting roll lets you pretend to feel something that you do not. The GM may also require an Acting roll whenever you try to fool someone, play dead in combat, etc.

Impersonation is a special type of acting. To impersonate someone, you must first successfully disguise yourself (see Disguise, p. 187) – unless your victims cannot see you!

Note that Acting is not the same as Fast-Talk (the art of the “quick con”) or Performance (the skill of screen and stage acting).

Modifiers: +1 for every point of IQ you have over the person you are trying to fool (or the smartest one in the group), or -1 for every point of difference if your victim is smarter than you; -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -5 for Truthfulness (p. 159), but only if you are trying to deceive someone. For impersonation only: -5 if you are not well acquainted with your subject; -5 if those you wish to fool are acquaintances of the subject (-10 for close acquaintances).

#### Alchemy
- IQ/Very Hard
- Defaults: None.

This is the study of magical transformations and transmutations. An alchemist is be able to identify concoctions with magical effects (“elixirs”), such as love potions and healing unguents, and prepare them from suitable ingredients. This is a mechanical process, using the mana inherent in certain things.

#### Animal Handling†
- IQ/Average
- Default: IQ-5.

This is the ability to train and work with animals. You must specialize in a category of animals – the more intelligent the animals, the narrower the category. Examples of interest to adventurers: Big Cats (jaguars, lions, tigers, etc.), Dogs, Equines (horses and donkeys), and Raptors (eagles, falcons, and hawks). The default between specialties is -2 within the same order (e.g., Dogs to Big Cats), -4 across orders (e.g., Dogs to Equines), and -6 for larger differences (e.g., Dogs to Raptors).

To train an animal, make an Animal Handling roll once per day of training. A failed roll means the animal learned nothing; a badly failed roll means you are attacked. The time it takes to train an animal depends on the beast’s intelligence and tractability (see Chapter 16).

When working with a trained animal, roll against skill for each task you set the animal. This roll is at -5 if the animal is not familiar with you, -5 if the circumstances are stressful to the animal, and -3 or more if the task is a complex one. To put on an entertaining circus act, snake-charming show, etc., you must make a separate Performance roll!

This skill can also (sometimes) be used to quiet a wild, dangerous, or untrained animal. This roll is at -5 if the creature is wild or very frightened, or -10 if it is a man-eater or man-killer.

Finally, this skill gives an advantage in combat against animals within your specialty. If you have Animal Handling at level 15, an animal’s attack and defense rolls are at -1 against you, because you can predict its behavior. At skill 20, the animal’s rolls are at -2.

#### Area Knowledge†
- IQ/Easy
- Defaults: IQ-4 or Geography (Regional)-3
* You have an IQ default only for Area Knowledge of a place where you live or once lived. Geography only gives a default for Area Knowledge of the specialty region.

This skill represents familiarity with the people, places, and politics of a given region.

The GM should not require Area Knowledge rolls for ordinary situations; e.g., to find the blacksmith, tavern, or your own home. But he could require a roll to locate a smith to shoe your horse at 3 a.m., or to find the best ambush spot along a stretch of road. “Secret” or obscure information might give a penalty, require a Lore skill, or simply be unavailable – GM’s decision. For instance, Area Knowledge of Washington, D.C. gives you the location of the Russian Embassy, but not the KGB’s current safe house.

The information covered by Area Knowledge often overlaps such skills as Geography, Survival, and Streetwise. The difference is that Area Knowledge works for a single area: you know the habits of this tiger or gang boss, but have no special insight into tigers or gangs in general.

You can learn Area Knowledge for any sort of area. The larger the territory, the less “personal” and more general your knowledge becomes. Almost everyone will have Area Knowledge of some type. The “canonical” area classes are:

Neighborhood: For an urban area: the residents and buildings of a few city blocks. For a rural area: the inhabitants, trails, streams, hiding places, ambush sites, flora, and fauna of a few hundred acres.

Village or Town: All important citizens and businesses, and most unimportant ones; all public buildings and most houses.

City: All important businesses, streets, citizens, leaders, etc. Barony, County, Duchy, or Small

Nation: General nature of its settlements and towns, political allegiances, leaders, and most citizens of Status 5+.

Large Nation: Location of its major cities and important sites; awareness of its major customs, ethnic groups, and languages (but not necessarily expertise); names of folk of Status 6+; and a general understanding of the economic and political situation.

Plane: As for a large nation, but more general; knowledge of people of Status 7+ only.

Your IQ-4 default applies to any of these classes, as long as you have lived in the area. Defaults are limited by “common knowledge”.

#### Biology†
- IQ/Very Hard
- Defaults: IQ-6 or Survival-6.

This is the scientific study of the structure, behavior, and habitats of living organisms. You must specialize in the life of a particular plane type. If you do not specify a plane type, your native plane type is assumed. The IQ default applies only to the plane type you grew up on. The default between different plane-type specialties is -4.

#### Boating†
- DX/Average
- Defaults: DX-5 or IQ-5.

This is the ability to handle a specific type of watercraft.

Make a roll to get underway, to dock, and whenever you encounter a hazard. If using this skill at default, also roll when you first enter the boat – to avoid falling in the water!

You must specialize:

Sailboat: Any small watercraft moving under sail. Defaults: Unpowered-3.

Unpowered: Any small watercraft that relies on muscle power, whether it is paddled, rowed, or poled. Includes canoes, rowboats, and rafts. Defaults: Sailboat-3.

Modifiers: -2 for an unfamiliar boat within your specialty (e.g., a kayak when you’re used to a rowboat); -3 or worse for foul weather, navigational hazards, etc.

#### Body Language
- Per/Average
- Defaults: Detect Lies-4.

This is the ability to interpret a person’s facial expressions and body posture in order to gauge his feelings. You can use it like the Empathy advantage (b. 51) or Detect Lies skill, but only on a subject you can see. You can also use it to get a rough idea of what a party member is doing or about to do in a situation where they cannot communicate with you directly (for instance, when using Stealth). You can only observe one subject at a time.

Modifiers: All Vision modifiers; physiology modifiers (b. 181); +4 if your subject is Easy to Read (b. 134). Anything that makes the subject harder to “read” gives a penalty: baggy clothing gives -1, a shield or a voluminous cloak gives from -2 to -4, and a mask gives -5 (and makes it impossible to use this skill if you cannot see the rest of the body!).

#### Body Sense
- DX/Hard
- Defaults: DX-6 or Acrobatics-3.

This is the ability to adjust quickly after teleportation or similar “instant movement.” A successful roll lets you act normally on your next turn. A failed roll means disorientation: you may take no action other than defense for one turn. A critical failure means you fall down, physically stunned!

Modifiers: +3 for either level of Absolute Direction (p. 34). -2 if you changed facing, or -5 if you went from vertical to horizontal or vice versa (you cannot change posture during a teleport – only orientation).

#### Camouflage
- IQ/Easy
- Defaults: IQ-4 or Survival-2.

This is the ability to use natural materials, special fabrics and paints, etc. to hide yourself, your position, or your equipment. To see through your camouflage, an observer must win a Quick Contest of Vision vs. your Camouflage skill.

Depending on the circumstances, successful camouflage might hide its subject entirely or merely blur its outlines to make it harder to hit (-1 to attacker’s skill). Camouflage will not improve your Stealth roll, but if you fail a Stealth roll while camouflaged, those who heard you must still see through your camouflage to see you.

Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345). Apply a penalty equal to the Size Modifier of a large object (e.g., -5 for a tent with SM +5). This makes it difficult to camouflage large objects, but remember that distant observers suffer large Vision penalties for range – see Vision (p. 358).

#### Carousing
- HT/Easy
- Default: HT-4.

This is the skill of socializing, partying, etc. A successful Carousing roll, under the right circumstances, gives you a +2 bonus on a request for aid or information, or just on a general reaction. A failed roll means you made a fool of yourself in some way; you get a -2 penalty on any reaction roll made by those you caroused with. If you do your carousing in the wrong places, a failed roll can have other dangers!

Modifiers: Up to +3 for buying drinks or other entertainment for your fellow carousers; -3 for Killjoy (p. 140); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154).

#### Climbing
- DX/Average
- Default: DX-5.

This is the ability to climb mountains, rock walls, trees, the sides of buildings, etc. See Climbing (p. 349) for details.

Modifiers: +2 for Brachiator (p. 41); +3 for Flexibility or +5 for Double-Jointed (p. 56); +1 for Perfect Balance (p. 74);  a penalty equal to encumbrance.

#### Cryptography
- IQ/Hard
- Default: None.

This is the ability to create and defeat encryption, codes, and ciphers.

Treat an attempt to break an unknown code as a Quick Contest of Cryptography skill between the code-breaker and code-maker. The code-breaker must win to break the code. Repeated attempts are possible, but each attempt takes a day. The code-maker rolls only once, when he first creates the code.

Cryptography normally has no IQ default, with two exceptions. Anyone can devise a trivial code or cipher by making an IQ-5 roll. This won’t stall a professional for long, of course. Likewise, anyone can make an IQ-5 roll to attempt to break such a trivial code (but not a code devised by someone with Cryptography skill), using the Quick Contest system described above.

Modifiers: Mathematical Ability (p. 90). The code-breaker is at +5 if he has a sample of the code with translation, and -5 if the message to be decoded is shorter than 25 words. The code-maker receives a bonus for the time taken to create the code: consult the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550), look up the time in days in the Range/Speed column (substituting “days” for “yards”), and use the corresponding bonus.

#### Detect Lies
- Per/Hard
- Defaults: Perception-6, Body Language-4, or Psychology-4.

This is the ability to tell when someone is lying to you. It is not the same as Interrogation; Detect Lies works in a casual or social situation. When you ask to use this skill, the GM rolls a Quick Contest of your Detect Lies skill vs. your subject’s IQ (or Fast-Talk or Acting skill). If you win, the GM tells you whether the subject is lying. If you lose, the GM may lie to you about whether you were lied to or just say, “You can’t tell.”

Modifiers: +1 for Sensitive or +3 for Empathy (p. 51), or -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); +4 if your subject is Easy to Read (p. 134). If the subject is of a different species, the GM may assess a penalty – see Physiology Modifiers (p. 181).

#### Diplomacy
- IQ/Hard
- Defaults: IQ-6.

This is the skill of negotiating, compromising, and getting along with others. You may substitute a Diplomacy roll for any reaction roll in a noncombat situation, as described under Influence Rolls.

Unlike other Influence skills, Diplomacy never gives a worse result than if you had tried an ordinary reaction roll. Failure with Fast-Talk or Sex Appeal alienates the subject, but Diplomacy is usually safe.

A successful roll also allows you to predict the possible outcome of a course of action when you are negotiating, or to choose the best approach to take.

If you know Diplomacy at level 20 or better, you get a +2 bonus on all reaction rolls!

Modifiers: +2 for Voice (p. 97); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -2 for Stuttering (p. 157).

#### Disguise†
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: IQ-5.

This is the art of altering your appearance using clothing, makeup, and prosthetics. You do not need this skill to don a quick disguise – e.g., to put on a lab coat when you enter a laboratory – but such disguises only fool the inattentive! A good disguise requires a Disguise roll and 30 minutes to an hour of preparation.

Roll a Quick Contest of Disguise skill vs. the Perception of each person your disguise must fool.

When combining Acting (p. 174) with Disguise (that is, when you must change your face and your personality), you need only make one roll for each person or group – but it must be the harder of the two rolls.

If there is more than one sapient species in your world, you must specialize by kin – Disguise (Foulkn) is not Disguise (Elf). Disguise skills for physically similar species default to one another at -2 to -4.

Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345). +4 for Elastic Skin (p. 51). You are at -1 to -5 to disguise yourself as someone very different from you (GM’s discretion). Distinctive appearance also gives a penalty – see Build (p. 18), Unnatural Features (p. 22), and specific disadvantages (e.g., Hunchback, p. 139) for details. Differences in Size Modifier usually make Disguise impossible.

You can also learn Disguise (Animals) to deceive nonsapient creatures. This involves wearing animal skins, smearing your body with musk or dung, etc. There is no default between this and other Disguise specialties. Use the following modifiers instead of those given above.

Modifiers: +2 if approaching from downwind; -1 for each animal over one of the same type being approached (-1 for every 10 in the case of herd animals); -1 to -3 if the skins are old or in poor condition. Make a Survival roll to recall the habits of the animal being imitated; success gives +1 to +3, while failure gives -1 to -3.

#### Driving†
- DX/Average
- Defaults: DX-5 or IQ-5.

This is the ability to drive a specific type of ground vehicle.

Make an IQ-based Driving roll for basic map reading, to diagnose simple malfunctions, or to recall rules of the road.

You must specialize:

Cart: A vehichle drawn by a beast. Defaults: Riding (Same animal)-2 and other driving -3

Land Sailor: The skill of driving land vehicles pushed by wind. Defaults: Boating (Sailboat)-3 and other Driving at -5.

Locomotive: Any vehicle that moves on conventional or maglev-rails. Default: other Driving at -5.

Mecha: Any kind of legged, bouncing, rolling, or slithering vehicle. Defaults: Battlesuit-3 or other Driving at -5.

Tracked: Any vehicle that moves on tracks. Defaults: Halftrack-2 or other Driving at -4.

Modifiers: -2 or more for bad driving conditions; -2 or more for a vehicle in bad repair;

#### Engineer†
- IQ/Hard
- Defaults: None.

This is the ability to design and build technological devices and systems. A successful roll lets you design a new system, diagnose a glitch, identify the purpose of a strange device, or improvise a gadget to solve a problem. Time required for each attempt is up to the GM.

Note that engineers are designers and inventors; they are not necessarily skilled at the routine operation or maintenance of the things they design! For instance, Engineer (Small Arms) lets you design a new assault rifle, but you need Guns skill to shoot it.

You must specialize. Possible fields include:

Artillery: Designing whatever passes for artillery in your setting, from trebuchets to smart missiles.

Civil: Planning highways, aqueducts, buildings, etc.

Clockwork: Designing wind-up gadgetry – watches, mechanical men, and the like.

Combat: Building or removing fortifications, trenches, etc. 

Golems: Designing golems and other non-clockwork constructs.

Small Arms: Designing personal firearms, such as guns and portable rocket launchers.

Vehicle Type: Designing a single, broad class of vehicle. Examples include Engineer (Automobiles), Engineer (Ships), and Engineer (Starships).

Engineer specialties normally default to one another at -4.

Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345). Up to +5 to build a gadget if you can give the GM a good description of what you want it to do.

#### Escape
- DX/Hard
- Default: DX-6.

This is the ability to slip out of ropes, handcuffs, and similar restraints. The first attempt to escape takes one minute; each subsequent attempt takes 10 minutes.

The GM may apply a penalty for particularly secure bonds. For instance, manacles would give -5 to Escape. You suffer only half these penalties if you dislocate the restrained limb (usually an arm). This requires (20 - skill) minutes of concentration, minimum one minute and a Will roll. However, if you fail your Escape roll by 3 or more when dislocating a limb, the limb suffers 1d damage. On a critical failure, you automatically take enough damage to cripple the limb!

Modifiers: +3 for Flexibility or +5 for Double-Jointed (p. 56); any bonus for Slippery (p. 85).

#### Fast-Talk
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: IQ-5 or Acting-5.

This is the skill of talking others into doing things against their better judgment. In any situation that calls for a reaction roll, you may make an Influence roll against Fast-Talk instead; see Influence Rolls.

If you have Fast-Talk at level 20 or better, you get +2 on all reaction rolls where you’re allowed to talk!

Note that Fast-Talk differs from Acting. In general, Fast-Talk is used to get someone to make a snap decision in your favor, while Acting is used for long-term dissimulation. However, there are situations in which the GM could allow a roll on either skill.

Modifiers: +2 for Voice (p. 97); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -2 for Stuttering (p. 157); -5 for Truthfulness (p. 159). The GM may ask you for details of the story you are using, rather than just let you say, “I’m using Fast-Talk.” Your approach and the plausibility of the story may further modify the roll, at the GM’s discretion.

#### First Aid
- IQ/Easy
- Defaults: IQ-4, Medicine.

This is the ability to patch up an injury in the field (see Recovery). Make a skill roll to halt bleeding, suck out poison, give artificial respiration to a drowning victim, etc. Unusual problems may need a successful Medicine roll to diagnose.

Modifiers: -5 with no equipment, -2 for improvised equipment; Different Physiologies have a penalty from 0 to -5. Foulkn vs Elves -2, Foulkn vs Trolls -4, Foulkn vs Animal -5.

#### Forgery
- IQ/Hard
- Defaults: IQ-6.

This is the ability to create falsified documents (identity cards, passports, etc.). It is not taught except by intelligence agencies and the underworld – although you can always study it on your own.

The time required to create a forgery ranges from days to weeks (GM decides). When you use a forged document, make your Forgery roll each time it is inspected – unless you roll a critical success on your first attempt. Failure means someone spots the forgery.

Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345); +3 if you merely altered a genuine document; -5 if you did not have a sample to copy. The GM may also assign modifiers based on the severity of the inspection; a routine border check, for instance, would give a +5 bonus.

#### Games†
- IQ/Easy
- Default: IQ-4.

This is the ability to play a game well. It includes knowledge of rules, etiquette, and tournament regulations. You must specialize in a particular game; possibilities include traditional board games (such as chess, Go, hnefatafl, and mankala), card games, war games, and sports.

Many cultures regard the ability to play one or more games skillfully as a worthwhile social accomplishment. People often stake vast sums on games, and it might be possible to earn a living as a professional. Games may also be played to settle disputes. A powerful monster or wizard might even challenge a hero to a game – with his life or the lives of his companions at stake!

#### Gesture
- IQ/Easy
- Default: IQ-4.

This is the ability to communicate through improvised hand signals. A successful skill roll will let you convey one simple idea to another person, or understand one simple idea he is attempting to get across to you. Gesture is not suited to complex communication, however.

Modifiers: Cultural Familiarity modifiers definitely apply! Different cultures develop distinct gesture vocabularies.

#### Heraldry
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: IQ-5 or Savoir-Faire (High Society)-3.

This is the skill of recognizing and designing coats of arms, crests, flags, tartans, and other emblems. A successful roll lets you recognize a knight or a noble from his banner or shield, create attractive and proper arms (without conflicting with existing designs), or recognize organized humans by their symbolism.

Modifiers: Cultural Familiarity modifiers (p. 23). Up to +5 to recognize a well-known design, and down to -5 for an obscure design or one that was retired long ago.

#### History†
- IQ/Hard
- Default: IQ-6.

This is the study of the recorded past. A successful skill roll lets you answer questions about history, and might (at the GM’s option) allow you to remember a useful parallel: “Ah, yes. Hannibal faced a situation like this once, and here’s what he did . . .”

You must specialize. There are two general classes of specialty:

• A limited geographical region – no larger than a small nation – over multiple eras. Examples: History (Bavarian), History (Irish), or History (New York State).

• A single era (e.g., Victorian period, 20th century) and one of a broad geographical region (e.g., Europe), a culture (e.g., Muslim), or an idea (e.g., economic, esoteric, or military). Examples: History (20th-Century American), History (Ottoman Muslim), or History (Napoleonic Military).

The sheer variety of possible specialties makes it impossible to list all possible defaults. In general, if two specialties overlap at all, then GM should permit a default at -2 to -4.

#### Hobby Skill
- DX or IQ/Easy
- Default: DX-4 or IQ-4, depending on the controlling attribute.

Many fields of study have little to do with adventuring or making a living – but people study them nonetheless. Each of these is a separate Hobby Skill. Those that require agility or a delicate touch (e.g., juggling, kite flying, needlepoint, and origami) are DX/Easy skills that default to DX-4, while those that focus on knowledge and trivia (e.g., comic books, rock music, science fiction, and tropical fish) are IQ/Easy skills that default to IQ-4.

A few points in a Hobby Skill can make roleplaying more fun – and possibly come in handy once in a while. You do not need a teacher to learn or improve a Hobby Skill. However, you cannot learn skills defined elsewhere in this chapter as Hobby Skills.

#### Interrogation
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: IQ-5, Intimidation-3, or Psychology-4.

This is the ability to question a prisoner. This is a very rarely taught skill. Reserved for war, law, or crime.

Roll a Quick Contest of Interrogation vs. the prisoner’s Will for each question. This requires 5 minutes per question. If you win, you get a truthful answer. If you tie or lose, the victim remains silent or lies. If you lose by more than five points, he tells you a good, believable lie! The GM makes all die rolls in secret.

Modifiers: -5 if the prisoner’s loyalty to his leader or cause is “Very Good” or “Excellent”; -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); +2 for a lengthy interrogation (over two hours); +3 if you use severe threats; +6 if you use torture*. Increase these last two bonuses by +1 if you have the Callous disadvantage (p. 125)!

“Torture”* does not necessarily mean thumbscrews and the rack. Exposing a prisoner to the object of his phobia is an effective torture, as is a believable threat against a loved one. Note that torturing a prisoner is usually considered vile behavior, likely bringing retribution.

#### Intimidation
- Will/Average
- Defaults: Will-5 or Acting-3.

This is the skill of hostile persuasion. The essence of Intimidation is to convince the subject that you are able and willing, perhaps even eager, to do something awful to them.

You can substitute an Intimidation attempt for any reaction roll; see Influence Rolls. Exception: You cannot intimidate someone who has the Unfazeable advantage!

The results of a successful Intimidation attempt depend on the target. An honest citizen probably cooperates, sullenly or with false cheer. A low-life might lick your boots (even becoming genuinely loyal). A really tough sort might react well without being frightened: “You’re my kind of scum!” The GM decides, and roleplays it. If you rolled a critical success – or if the subject critically failed his Will roll – your victim must make a Fright Check in addition to the other results of the Influence roll!

Group Intimidation: You may attempt to intimidate up to 25 people at once, at -1 to skill per five people (or fraction thereof) in the group. Multiple intimidators can attempt to intimidate proportionally larger groups; for instance, three thugs could try to intimidate up to 75 people! Base the skill penalty on the size of the target group divided by the number of intimidators (round up). Resolve the outcome with a single Quick Contest: the highest effective Intimidation skill from among the intimidators vs. the highest modified Will in the target group.

Modifiers: +1 to +4 for displays of strength, bloodthirstiness, or supernatural powers (GM’s judgment); increase this bonus by +1 if you are Callous (p. 125). Appearance (p. 21) matters: +2 if you are Hideous, +3 if Monstrous, or +4 if Horrific. Size also matters: add your Size Modifier and subtract the subject’s. Appropriate Reputation modifiers (positive or negative) certainly count! You get -1 for Oblivious (p. 146) and -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154). Subtract the subject’s Fearlessness (p. 55) from your roll. The GM may assign a +1 or -1 for especially appropriate or clumsy dialog. Requests for aid are always at -3 or worse.

#### Knot-Tying
- DX/Easy
- Defaults: DX-4, Climbing-4, or Seamanship-4.

This is the ability to tie a wide variety of knots quickly and efficiently. A successful skill roll lets you make a noose, tie someone up, etc. If you bind someone using this skill, he must win a Quick Contest of Escape vs. your Knot-Tying skill to free himself.

Modifiers: +1 per level of High Manual Dexterity (p. 59), or -3 per level of Ham-Fisted (p. 138).

#### Leadership
- IQ/Average
- Default: IQ-5.

This is the ability to coordinate a group. Make a Leadership roll to lead NPCs into a dangerous or stressful situation. (PCs can decide for themselves if they want to follow you!)

You may attempt a Leadership roll in combat if you spend your turn doing nothing but giving orders and encouragement. On a success, everyone on your side who can hear you (including PCs) has +1 on all combat-related Fright Checks and morale checks, and on self-control rolls for disadvantages that would reduce combat efficiency (such as Berserk and Cowardice – or Bloodlust, if you wish to take prisoners). A critical success gives +2. The bonus lasts until your next turn, at which time you may roll again. A group can have only one leader, however! If multiple people attempt Leadership rolls, no one gets a bonus.

Note that a minimum level of Leadership is often a prerequisite for high Rank.

Modifiers: Any bonus for Charisma; -3 for Low Empathy; -1 to -4 for Shyness. -5 if the NPCs have never been in action with you; -5 if you are sending them into danger but not going yourself; +5 if their loyalty to you is “Good”; +10 if their loyalty is “Very Good.” If their loyalty is “Excellent,” you do not have to roll!

#### Lip Reading
- Per/Average
- Default: Perception-10.

This is the ability to see what others are saying. You must be within seven yards, or have some means of bringing your point of view this close. A successful skill roll lets you make out one sentence of a discussion – assuming, of course, that you know the language. If your subjects suspect that you can read lips, they can hide their mouths or subvocalize to thwart you. A critical failure on a Lip Reading roll – if you are where your victims could see you – means that you stared so much you were noticed!

Modifiers: All Vision modifiers (see Vision, p. 358).

#### Lockpicking
- IQ/Average
- Default: IQ-5.

This is the ability to open locks without the key or combination. Each attempt requires one minute. If you make the roll and open the lock, each point by which you succeeded shaves five seconds off the required time. (Safecracking and similar challenges can take more time, at the GM’s discretion.)

Note that if the lock has a trap or alarm attached, you must make a separate Traps roll to circumvent it.

Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345); -5 if working by touch (e.g., in total darkness). Inside information gives a bonus at GM’s discretion. If the GM requires a DX-based roll (for instance, to work with a particularly delicate mechanism), modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-Fisted (p. 138) will apply.

#### Lore†
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: None.

This skill represents niche bodies of knowledge. It is only available to those who study it specifically.

You must specialize in a particular body of knowledge. If you wish to enter play with Lore skills, you must account for this specific knowledge in your character story. The GM might even require you to purchase an Unusual Background before you can learn Hidden Lore skills.

To acquire Lore in play, you must find a reliable source of relevant information. The GM may choose to tie skill increases in Lore to specific acts – such as reading moldy tomes – instead of allowing you to spend points freely. For instance, an ancient manuscript might let you spend up to eight points (and no more) on a specific Lore skill.

Remember that most Hidden Lore is secret because somebody powerful wants it kept that way. Thus, discussing or revealing your knowledge can be extremely hazardous.

Possible Lore specialties include:

Conspiracies: You know details about the conspiracies that underlie every aspect of society. This is factual knowledge (e.g., truths about the Illuminati), not the ability to analyze conspiracies. Only available in settings where vast conspiracies really do exist.

Demon Lore: You know the secrets of Hell, the goals of demons in the mortal world, and possibly even the names of specific demons.

Faerie Lore: You have detailed knowledge of the faeries and their secret kingdom(s).

Spirit Lore: You know about ghosts and other spirit entities – names, motivations, etc.

#### Medicine
- Per/Hard
- Default: Perception-6.

This is the skill of treating illness and injury with advanced techniques. It is usually associated with a magical or spiritual tradition. The particulars vary by tradition, but might include acupuncture, massage, alchemical or herbal preparations, or such exercises as breath control and meditation.

Make a skill roll to hasten natural recovery from injury, and whenever the GM requires a roll to test general medical competence or knowledge. For every level beyond 13 you may tend to someone during a long rest, giving them a +1 to their HT rolls to recover. Once every 3 days you may roll against medicine to heal someone 1 HP per 10 max HP (2 on a crit).

Modifiers: Different Physiologies have a penalty from 0 to -5. Foulkn vs Elves -2, Foulkn vs Trolls -4, Foulkn vs Animal -5.
#### Mimicry†
- IQ/Hard
- Defaults: IQ-6 and others.

This is the ability to imitate voices. The Voice advantage (p. 97) gives +2 to skill. You must specialize:

Animal Sounds: Lets you emulate a lion’s roar, a wolf’s howl, a frog’s croak, etc. You can only imitate animals that have distinctive sounds. Make a skill roll to attract animals of the type mimicked – or predators that normally hunt those animals – if any are nearby. To fool people, you must win a Quick Contest of Mimicry vs. the listeners’ Naturalist-3 or Perception-6. Default: Naturalist-6.

Bird Calls: Allows you to reproduce the whistles, chirps, and other sounds made by birds. Otherwise, this works as Animal Sounds. Default: Naturalist-6.

Speech: Enables you to imitate vocal sounds. This does not allow you to converse in a foreign language, but if you have heard it, you can reproduce the sound of it. If you are trying to mimic a specific person, roll at -3. Treat this roll as a Quick Contest vs. the IQ of anyone who knows the person mimicked well. Defaults: Acting-6 or Linguistics-4.

Animal Sounds and Bird Calls default to one another at -6. There is no default between these specialties and Speech.

Note that if you have the Mimicry advantage (p. 68), there is no need to learn this skill!

#### Navigation†
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: Special.

This is the ability to find your position through careful observation of your surroundings and the use of instrumentation. A successful roll tells you where you are or lets you plot a course.

You must specialize:

Sea: Navigation by the stars and ocean currents. Modifiers: +3 if you have Absolute Direction (p. 34); -5 (and no use of Astronomy default) if the weather is bad, and the stars are hidden.
	Defaults: Astronomy-5 or Seamanship-5.

Air: Navigation by the stars and by the terrain below. Modifiers are as for Navigation (Sea).
	Default: Astronomy-5.

Land: Navigation using landmarks and the stars; also called “orienteering.” Modifiers: +3 if you have Absolute Direction or a high-tech substitute.
	Defaults: IQ-5, Cartography-4, or Mathematics (Surveying)-4.

Air, Land, and Sea default to one another at -2.

Modifiers: -1 to -10 for being in an unfamiliar area (GM’s discretion, but an unfamiliar world, star system, etc. should give at least -5); equipment modifiers (p. 345).

#### Occultism
- IQ/Average
- Default: IQ-5.

This is the study of the mysterious and the supernatural. An occultist is an expert on ancient rituals, hauntings, mysticism, primitive magical beliefs, psychic phenomena, etc.

Occultism covers lore about these powers and their users. A good roll might provide insights into phenomena that aren’t related to known powers. However, Occultism provides no details on how talented individuals invoke their powers. For instance, an occultist would know what magic can accomplish, and could provide advice on slaying demons, but without the Thaumatology skill, he could not explain the gestures, words, and symbols used by wizards.

The GM may require occultists to specialize in such fields as Demonology (the study of demons, possession, and pacts), Pneumatology (the study of spirits), and Vampirology (the study of vampires).

#### Performance
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: IQ-5, Acting-2, or Public Speaking-2.

This is the ability to act on the stage or screen. It is different from Acting in that you are trying to impress and entertain people – not deceive them. If you studied this skill formally, it includes the knowledge expected of a professional actor from your culture and tech level (stage directions, actor-agent-producer relations, etc.).

Modifiers: +2 for Voice (p. 97); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -2 for Stuttering (p. 157).
#### Pickpocket
- DX/Hard
- Defaults: DX-6, Filch-5, or Sleight of Hand-4.

This is the ability to steal a purse, knife, etc., from someone’s person – or to “plant” something on him.

If your victim is aware someone may try to pick his pocket, or if he is generally wary, you must win a Quick Contest of Pickpocket vs. the higher of his Perception or Streetwise skill. To outwit a third party who is watching you and the victim, you must win a Quick Contest of Pickpocket vs. the watcher’s Observation skill.

Modifiers: +5 if the victim is distracted; +10 if he is asleep or drunk; up to -5 for goods in an inner pocket; and up to -10 for a ring or similar jewelry. 

#### Professional Skill
- DX or IQ/Average
- Defaults: Special.

Many realistic job skills are more useful for making a living than for adventuring. Most such skills do not appear in this skill list – but you can still learn them if you want! Each is a separate Professional Skill. If your “adventuring” skills aren’t useful for earning money, a Professional Skill can help you earn a steady income. To qualify for most jobs, you will need the relevant Professional Skill at 12+ (unless you are supposed to be incompetent!).

Most professions encompass a body of knowledge. The associated Professional Skills are IQ/Average and default to IQ-5, because the smarter you are, the better you can recall and employ the techniques used at your job. Examples include air traffic controller, barber, brewer, cooper, distiller, dyer, florist, game designer, journalist, prostitute, tanner, vintner, and zookeeper.

A few professions – glassblower, tailor, weaver, etc. – focus more on precision than on recall. These Professional Skills are DX/Average and default to DX-5.

At the GM’s option, a given Professional Skill might also default to other skills. For instance, “Journalist” would logically default to Writing-3.

The skills associated with highly paid or respected professions often have prerequisites. For instance, “Air Traffic Controller” might require Electronics Operation (Sensors) skill. Like defaults, prerequisites are up to the GM.

You are free to create your own Professional Skills, subject to GM approval. They should be unique and well defined, not just a compilation of existing skills. For example:

#### Public Speaking
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: IQ-5, Acting-5, Performance-2, or Politics-5.

This is general talent with the spoken word. A successful skill roll lets you (for instance) give a good political speech, entertain a group around a campfire, incite or calm a riot, or put on a successful “court jester” act.

Public Speaking includes skill with debate, oratory, and rhetoric, as well as ability with less formal activities such as “punning” and storytelling. Not all speakers possess talent in all of these areas. You may take an optional specialty (p. 169) to represent this.

Modifiers: Any bonus for Charisma (p. 41); +2 for Voice (p. 97); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -2 for Stuttering (p. 157); Cultural Familiarity modifiers (p. 23); Language modifiers (p. 24).

#### Religious Ritual†
- IQ/Hard
- Defaults: Ritual Magic (same)-6 or Theology (same)-4.

This is the ability to perform religious rites – masses, funerals, weddings, etc. – before a congregation. You must specialize by religion. This skill includes detailed knowledge of the ritual motions, prayers, and trappings of the faith, as well as the ability to capture and hold the attention of worshipers. For religions that practice sacrifice, Religious Ritual also covers familiarity with sacrificial tools and methods.

To be a priest or holy man at TL1+, you must have both Religious Ritual and Theology skill (p. 226) for your religion. TL0 shamans need only learn Religious Ritual.

In worlds where priests can perform miracles, each magical ritual or spell is a separate skill, but certain “mundane” religious rituals – such as sacrifice – can give bonuses to spell rolls. You must always make a successful Religious Ritual roll to claim such a bonus. In other settings, a priest’s magic is only as good as his ritual. If this is the case, your roll to work magic is against the lower of Religious Ritual and your actual spell skill.

#### Research
- IQ/Average
- Defaults: IQ-5.
- Prerequisite: literacy in at least one language.

This is the ability to do library and file research. Roll against skill to find a useful piece of data in an appropriate place of research . . . if the information is there to be found.

At the GM’s option, when researching material connected with a “book-learned” skill such as Forensics, Literature, or Physics, you may roll against that skill at -2 instead, if that would be better than your Research skill or default (but this is not a general default level).

Modifiers: Language modifiers (p. 24), for research materials in a foreign tongue.

#### Riding†
- DX/Average
- Defaults: DX-5 or Animal Handling (same)-3.

This is the ability to ride a particular kind of mount. Make a skill roll when you first try to mount a riding animal, and again each time something happens to frighten or challenge the creature (e.g., a jump).

You must specialize by riding beast. Defaults between specialties vary from 0 to -10. For instance, if you have Riding (Horse), Riding (Mule) is essentially the same skill (no default penalty), Riding (Camel) would default at -3, Riding (Dolphin) at -6, and Riding (Dragon) at a whopping -10!

Modifiers: +5 if the animal knows and likes you; +1 or more for a mount with the Mount skill (p. 210); -10 if the animal has not been trained for riding.

#### Savoir-Faire†
- IQ/Easy
- Defaults: IQ-4 and others.

This is the skill of appropriate behavior in a subculture that has an established code of conduct – for instance, high society or the military. When dealing with that social group, a successful skill roll lets you interact without embarrassing yourself, detect pretenders to high standing, and so on. You may also substitute an Influence roll against Savoir-Faire for any reaction roll required in a social situation involving that subculture; see Influence Rolls (p. 359). Roll once per encounter.

You must specialize. Common specialties include:

High Society: The manners of those of “good” birth and breeding. Status determines relative standing. Roll against skill whenever you must impersonate someone more than three Status levels away from your own. If your Status is negative and you are trying to pass yourself off as someone of Status 1+, or vice versa, this roll is at -2.

Mafia: Proper conduct within a formal criminal organization. This includes such things as codes of silence and showing proper deference to “made men.” These protocols often ape those of high society . . . but the penalties for misconduct are far more severe. Default: Streetwise-3.

Military: The customs, traditions, and regulations of military service. This also includes knowledge of the unwritten rules: what is acceptable even if not regulation, and what is forbidden although there is nothing in writing against it. Military Rank determines relative standing.

Modifiers: Cultural Familiarity modifiers (p. 23). +2 if you are of higher standing than those you are trying to impress, or -2 if you are of lower standing (“standing” might mean Rank, Status, skill level, or something else). +2 if you seem to have important friends. -4 for Clueless (p. 126); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154).

#### Search
- Per/Average
- Defaults: Perception-5 or Criminology-5.

This is the ability to search people, baggage, and vehicles for items that aren’t in plain sight. The GM rolls once – in secret – per item of interest. For deliberately concealed items, this is a Quick Contest of your Search skill vs. the Holdout or Smuggling skill used to hide the item. If you fail, the GM simply says, “You found nothing.” (It defeats the purpose to say, “You don’t find the gun under his jacket.”)

If more than one person is searching, roll separately for each searcher.

The GM should avoid unnecessary rolls. For instance, no human can get a sawed-off shotgun through a body search. Likewise, a knife or jewel simply cannot be found on a normally dressed person without an X-ray or skin search. In general, if the net bonus to the concealer’s Holdout roll is +3 or more, a skin search is required. If his Holdout is at -2 or worse for size, a skin search will automatically find the hidden item.

Modifiers: +1 for a “pat-down” of an unresisting person (takes one minute), +3 for a thorough “skin search” of a person’s hair and clothing (takes three minutes), or +5 for a complete search, including body cavities (takes five minutes). Bonuses for Acute Touch (p. 35) and Sensitive Touch (p. 83) apply to all hands-on searches. On a successful Electronics Operation (Security) roll, specialized sensors – metal detectors, X-ray machines, etc. – give from +1 to +5 to find items they can detect (a metal detector won’t help you find plastic explosives!).

#### Sex Appeal
- HT/Average
- Default: HT-3.

This is the ability to impress those who are attracted to members of your gender. It has as much to do with attitude as it does with looks.

You may substitute an Influence roll against Sex Appeal for any reaction roll made by someone who is attracted to members of your sex; see Influence Rolls (p. 359).

Usually, you may make only one attempt per “target,” although the GM might allow another attempt after a few weeks.

Modifiers: +2 for Voice (p. 97); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -2 for Stuttering (p. 157). Apply any bonus for above-average appearance (p. 21) – or double the penalty for below-average appearance!

#### Sleight of Hand
- DX/Hard
- Defaults: DX-5, Pickpocket-4

This skill lets you steal objects that are sitting in plain sight “palm” small objects, do coin and card tricks, etc. without being spotted. Roll against skill to shoplift, snatch documents off a desk, etc. If someone is actively watching the item you wish to snatch, you must win a Quick Contest of Sleight of Hand vs. their Perception roll to perform the theft unnoticed.

Sleight of Hand only covers the theft itself. The GM might require rolls against Stealth to get close enough to make the attempt.

You can also use this skill to cheat at cards, dice, etc. A successful Sleight of Hand roll gives from +1 to +5 on your Gambling roll. Any failure causes you to be denounced as a cheater! In both cases, the exact results are up to the GM.

Modifiers: +3 if the light is dim; +3 if you have a confederate to distract attention. +5 if you have prepared in advance (cards up your sleeve, etc.); -3 if the person you want to fool knows Sleight of Hand himself; modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-Fisted (p. 138).

#### Stealth
- DX/Average
- Defaults: DX-5 or IQ-5.

This is the ability to hide and to move silently. A successful roll lets you conceal yourself anywhere except in a totally bare room, or move so quietly that nobody will hear you, or follow someone without being noticed.

If someone is specifically on the alert for intruders, the GM will roll a Quick Contest between your Stealth and the sentinel’s Perception.

You can also use this skill to stalk game. A successful roll (and about 30 minutes) gets you within 30 yards of most animals. Another roll, at -5, gets you within 15 yards.

Modifiers: A penalty equal to your Encumbrance. -5 to hide in an area without good hiding places, or +3 or more if there are many hiding places. -5 to move silently if you are moving faster than Move 1. -5 to fool those with Discriminatory Smell (e.g., dogs).

#### Streetwise
- IQ/Average
- Default: IQ-5.

This is the skill of getting along in rough company. A successful Streetwise roll might let you learn (among other things) where any sort of illegal “action” is; which local cops or bureaucrats can be bought, and for how much; and how to contact the local underworld. This skill is a measure of your ability to make new connections as needed.

You may substitute an Influence roll against Streetwise for any reaction roll made in an underworld or “bad neighborhood” situation.

Modifiers: +3 if you have a tough reputation (either “good” or “bad”) in the area; -3 if you are obviously a stranger in the area. -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154).

#### Survival†
- IQ/Hard
- Defaults: IQ-6 or Biology-3.

This skill represents practical (as opposed to scientific) knowledge of nature in its many forms. It includes just enough Biology to tell dangerous plants and animals from benign ones; just enough Geology to locate a cave to shelter in; and just enough Meteorology to know when to take shelter. Roll vs. skill to do any of these things.

You must specialize by plane; Material, Fire, Water, Earth, Air, etc..

#### Swimming
- HT/Easy
- Default: HT-4.

This is the skill of swimming, whether on purpose or to keep afloat in emergencies. Roll against the higher of Swimming or HT to avoid fatigue while swimming or injury due to aquatic misfortunes.

When racing someone of equal water Move, roll a Quick Contest of Swimming to determine the winner.

Modifiers: +3 if entering the water intentionally. A penalty equal to double Encumbrance.

#### Tactics
- IQ/Hard
- Defaults: IQ-6.

This is the ability to outguess and outmaneuver the enemy in small-unit or personal combat. In most settings, only the military teaches this skill.

When commanding a small unit, roll against Tactics to place your troops correctly for an ambush, know where to post sentries, etc. At the GM’s option, a successful roll might even provide clues as to immediate enemy plans. To outmaneuver enemy units, you must win a Quick Contest of Tactics with their leader. All of this only applies when you lead a group small enough that you can give each warrior orders personally – or through at most one subordinate. Thus, radio and similar technologies can greatly enhance your command abilities!

In personal combat, you may make a Tactics roll before the fight begins if you had any time to prepare. On a success, you start the fight in an advantageous position – e.g., behind cover or on higher ground – as determined by the GM. The better the roll, the greater your advantage. If you fail, or do not attempt a Tactics roll, you are in a random location (or one of the GM’s choosing) when combat begins. Fighters without Tactics skill always start combat this way.

Even in an ambush or similar “surprise” situation, the GM will use the better of your Tactics skill and your Perception to see if you spotted the danger on time.

#### Teaching
- IQ/Average
- Default: IQ-5.

This is the ability to instruct others. If you have Teaching at level 12+, you may act as a teacher for game purposes. For more on teaching and learning, see Improvement Through Study (p. 292).

Modifiers: -3 for Callous (p. 125); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 142). Apply both the teacher’s and the student’s Language penalties.

#### Thaumatology
- IQ/Very Hard
- Default: IQ-7

This is the academic study of magical theory and the “physics” of mana. Anyone may learn this skill, but it is easier for a mage; add Magery to IQ when learning this skill, just as for spells.

The main use for this skill is magical research. When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide.

This is the study of fantasy magic – fireball spells, rings of power, etc. The equivalent skill for traditional, spirit-mediated sorcery is Ritual Magic (p. 218), while holy magic might require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or Theology (p. 226). However, a Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a thaumatologist to relate these different varieties of magic to “standard” wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers or otherworldly artifacts might give a larger penalty!

#### Theology†
- IQ/Hard
- Defaults: IQ-6 or Religious Ritual (same)-4.

This is the study of a particular religion: its gods, cosmology, doctrines, scriptures, etc. You must specialize by religion. There are usually no defaults between specialties, but the GM might permit a default at -4 or so for belief systems that have similar origins, or where one is derived from the other.

Alternatively, you may study the similarities and differences between religions; this is Theology (Comparative). The Theology of any religion routinely studied by scholars in your game world defaults to this specialty at -5.

To be a priest or holy man at TL1+, you must have both Theology and Religious Ritual skill (p. 217) for your religion. TL0 shamans need only learn Religious Ritual.

You do not necessarily believe in the religion you study – faith comes from within, not from book learning! If you do, you may ask the GM to make a secret roll against your Theology skill when confronted with moral uncertainty. On a success, the GM will advise you on which course of action “feels” right, given your beliefs and understanding of scripture.

#### Tracking
- Per/Average
- Defaults: Per-5 or Survival-5.

This is the ability to follow a man or an animal by its tracks. Make a Tracking roll to pick up the trail, then roll periodically to avoid losing it. The frequency and difficulty of these rolls depend on the terrain:

- Jungle, Plains, or Woodlands: Roll every 30 minutes.
- Arctic, Desert, Island/Beach, or Mountain: Roll at -2 every 15 minutes.
- Swampland: Roll at -4 every 5 minutes.
- Urban: Roll at -6 every minute!

You may also use this skill to cover your tracks. This doubles your travel time! A successful roll means you have hidden your tracks well enough that only someone else with this skill can see them. If another tracker follows you, the Tracking rolls above become Quick Contests of Tracking skill. If he loses any of the Contests, he loses your trail.

To stalk game once you have tracked it, use the Stealth skill (p. 222).

Modifiers: -5 if the trail is more than a day old, or -10 if more than a week old. +3 if you are following a man, or +6 if following a group of men. Superior senses help a lot: bonuses for Acute Vision (p. 35) and Discriminatory Smell (p. 49) usually apply, and many superhuman senses (Infravision, Subsonic Hearing, etc.) give situational bonuses.

# Weapons
#### Axe/Mace - DX/A
Any impact weapon, such as an axe, hatchet, knobbed club, or pick. Default: Polearm-4.

#### Bow - DX/A
This is the ability to use the longbow, short bow, and all similar bows.

#### Brawling - DX/E
This is the skill of unarmed combat but also covers the use of saps and brass knuckles. 

#### Cloak - DX/A
This is the skill of using a cloak or a cape as a weapon. Offensively, you can use a cloak to entangle an opponent or to Feint. Defensively, a cloak works like a shield. It provides a Defense Bonus and gives a Block defense equal to (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Default: Shield-4, or Net-4

#### Crossbow - DX/E
This is the ability to use all types of crossbows, including the pistol crossbow, prodd (which fires pellets or stones), and repeating crossbow. Default: Gun-3

#### Fencing - DX/A
Fencing weapons are light, one-handed weapons, usually hilted blades, optimized for parrying. This includes Rapiers, Main-gauche, and some Sabers. Default: Sword-4.

#### Flail - DX/H
Any flail or whip type weapon, such as a morningstar or nunchaku.

#### Gun† (Sidearm, Longarm, Scatterarm) - DX/E
This is the ability to use a hand-held chemical-propellant or mass-driver projectile weapon. Default: Crossbow-3, or Gun-2

#### Innate Attack† (Beam, Breath, Gaze, Projectile) - DX/E
This skill represents trained ability with a “built-in” ranged attack: fiery breath, super-powered energy bolts, etc. Most commonly used for targeting with magic. Default: Innate Attack-2

#### Knife - DX/E
Any rigid, hilted blade less than one foot long, from a pocketknife to a bowie knife. A knife has a very small parrying surface, which gives you -1 to your Parry score. Defaults: Rapier-3, or Sword-3.

#### Net - DX/H
This is the ability to use a net as a thrown or melee weapon to trap and restrain targets. Default: Cloak-5

#### Polearm - DX/A
Any very long (at least 2 yards), unbalanced pole weapon with a heavy striking head, including the glaive, halberd, poleaxe, and countless others. Polearms become unready after an attack, but not after a parry. Defaults: Spear/Staff-4, or Axe/Mace-4.

#### Shield - DX/E
This is the ability to use a shield, both to block and to attack. Your active defense with any kind of shield – your Block score – is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down.

#### Sling - DX/H
This is the ability to use a sling or staff sling.

#### Spear/Staff - DX/A
Any long, balanced pole weapon with a thrusting or striking head, including spears, javelins, tridents, and simple wooden poles. Defaults: Polearm-4.

#### Sword - DX/A
A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both. All swords are balanced, and can attack and parry without becoming unready. Default: Fencing-4, or Knife-4.

# Techniques
You (or your GM!) may want a way to improve your ability with a specific application of a skill without increasing the overall skill level. Allowing this in the game makes play (and character sheets) more complex. As a result, the following section is purely optional.

You need not buy a technique to use it. If you have even one point in a skill, you may use all that skill’s techniques at default. To avoid a cluttered character sheet, though, only note techniques that you know at better than default level.
