# Gurps Simple Fantasy
Collected here are all the rules actively in use in our game. Any time this collection of rules falls short the Game Master is encouraged to wing it, potentially looking up the rule in GURPS later if it is expected to come up again.

This will function as a living and growing tool. With new rules and clarifications added as time goes on and more is played.
